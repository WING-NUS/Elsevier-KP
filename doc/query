Fructose 1,6-diphosphatase (FDPase) from skeletal muscle of the Alaskan king crab (Paralithodes camtschatica) occurs as a single form with an isoelectric point (pn of about 5&#x7e;2 in the cold-acclimatized animal, and as a single form with a pI value of 5&#x7e;8 in the warm-acclimatized animal. 2.

INTRODUCTION A SPECIAL manifestation of metabolic control in ectotherms is seen in an adjustment of metabolism in compensation to a change in ambient temperature. It appears that in the short term such temperature compensation is made possible, at least in part, by a low-temperature-induced increase in affinity of the ectothermic enzyme for its substrate(s). This behaviour has been frequently described and appears to be a mechanism that would counter the effect of a drop in temperature on the rate of the reaction and would in this manner tend to hold intermediary metabolism more or less independent of thermal change (see Hochachka &amp; Somero, 1971, for a recent review). However, many ectotherms experience on a seasonal basis rather wide changes in environmental temperatures, changes that far exceed the temperature range over which a particular seasonal variant can be regulated under physiological conditions of substrate, cofactor and modulators. For example, in acetylcholinesterase from brain of rainbow trout (Baldwin, 1971), the Antarctic fish Trematomus bernachii (Sornero &amp; Hochachka, 1968), the Alaskan king crab (Somero, 1969) and the fructose diphosphatase from skeletal muscle of the king crab (Behrisch, 1971, 1973) values of the apparent Michaelis constant (Km) for substrates) increase markedly at the extremes of the temperature 317 ranges tested, resulting in a characteristic U-shaped Km temperature curve. In virtually all of these cases the increase in the apparent Km is so great that at temperatures above and below the tempera ture of minimum Km which approximates closely the temperature of acclimatization-it would be very difficult indeed for changes in the degree of saturation by substrate of the enzyme molecule to occur in vivo. Consequently, it is argued, control of the enzyme would become physiologically impossible, and the enzyme variant can no longer function to maintain an effective integration of metabolism. It thus appears that in animals that experience large thermal changes on a seasonal basis, acclimatization involves (at least in part) the production of new enzyme variants that are more efficiently regulated at the new acclimatization temperature (see Baldwin &amp; Hochachka, 1970; Hochachka &amp; Somero, 1971; Behrisch, 1973). It ought to be mentioned, parenthetically, that acclimatization must also involve the equally important, and obviously finely regulated, break down or interconversion of the old (now non adapted) isoenzymes to the new. In this connection, hibernating Arctic ground squirrels (Citellus undu lates) that are preparing to emerge from hibernation do not show any appreciable variation in activities of fructose 1,6-diphosphatase or pyruvate kinase in 318 liver, even though large changes in the profiles of the isoenzymes are seen (Behrisch, 1974). The new thermally induced isoenzymes retain the salient features of control, but the temperature at which control is exerted most efficiently is now shifted to the new acclimatization temperature. This mechanism appears to be a basic and fairly common feature of metabolism in ectatherms that must adapt to wide seasonal temperature changes. However, it is not at all clear whether acclimatization involves a covalent modification of the existing enzyme molecule which can markedly alter enzyme function and its control (Haschke et al., 1972; Martensen &amp; Graves, 1973; Medicus &amp; Mendocino, 1973), or the complete replacement of the old with a new enzyme variant. Yet another option that might be open to the cell is the replacement of key portions of the enzyme molecule with homologous sections that satisfy the steric requirements of the total enzyme, but alter also the relationship between temperature and conformation of the molecule. Whichever is the case, and there may well be more factors, or any combination of these in vivo, it is of some value to attempt to relate some of the observed functional differences in such isoenzymes to apparent physical alterations in the enzyme molecule. The present paper deals with some aspects of the subunit structure of seasonal isoenzymes of fructose 1,6diphosphatase (FDPase) from skeletal muscle of the Alaska king crab Paralithodes camtschatica. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental animals Alaska king crabs (Paralithodes camtschatica) were captured live in Kachemak Bay, Alaska, in early summer and winter. Conditions at the time of capture were about 9 and -1 &#x7e;5 C, respectively. The crabs were held at the temperature of acclimatization until used in the preparation of enzyme. After the animals had been killed the tissues were quickly frozen and stored in a deep freeze at -30 C. No discernible loss of FDPase activity was noted after 6 months of storage in this manner. Preparation of enzyme As it was found that skeletal muscle from different regions of the body contains varying specific activities of FDPase and other gluconeogenic enzymes (Behrisch, unpublished findings), muscle was taken from the proximal segment of the walking legs of the crab, which contains the highest specific activities of FDPase. Homogenate of skeletal muscle was prepared in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7&#x7e;8 in a VirTis Model 23 homogenizer at top speed at 0-1 C. The homogenate was spun at 30,000 g for 60 min at 1 C and the pellet discarded. The supernatant was brought to 10% saturation with solid (NH4)2S04 and stirred for 2 hr at 1 C. The suspension was then centrifuged at 1 C, the pellet discarded and the supernatant slowly brought to 45% saturation with solid (NH4)ZS04 and stirred once more for about 2 hr at 1 C. The precipitate was collected by centrifuga- HANS W. BEHRISCH tion at 1 C and redissolved in a minimal volume of lOmM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7&#x7e;8 at 1 C. The enzyme solution was then dialyzed at I-2 C against the same buffer for 4 hr with a change in buffer after the first 2 hr. The enzyme preparation was loaded on a 440 ml preparative electrofocussing column; electrofocussing was over a pH 3-10 gradient for 20 hr at 400 V and 0&#x7e;5 mA and at 0-1 C. The fractions that contained the greatest FDPase activity were used in the further purification of FDPase. Catalytic activity at this level was about 200-300 millimoles of substrate transformed/hr per ml of preparation. The volume of this enzyme preparation was reduced by about two-thirds with the use of Lyphogel macromolecular concentration (Gelman Instruments Co., Ann Arbor, Michigan) at 4 C. FDPase activity as measured by inorganic phosphate release was about 500-600 m-moles Pi/hr per ml of enzyme. The preparation was then applied to a Sephadex G-200 column (254 x 27 em) which was eluted at 1-2 C with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7&#x7e;8, containing the substrate FDP at a concentration of 10 mM. FDPase activity descended through the column as a single symmetrical peak which matched closely the peak for protein elution. Ultracentrifugation studies The sample and five internal standards, purified beef heart lactate dehydrogenase (mol. wt 142,000), bovine hemoglobin (mol. wt 68,000) (Worthington Chem.), rabbit liver FDPase (mol. wt 130,000), rabbit muscle phosphorylase a (mol. wt 370,000) and Arctic ground squirrel liver pyruvate kinase (mol. wt 243,000) (Behrisch &amp; Johnson, 1974), were layered on 4&#x7e;6 ml linear 5-20% (w/v) sucrose density gradients that were made up in 100 mM triethanolamine-HCl buffer, pH 7&#x7e;0. These were centrifuged at 39,000 rev/min for 155 hr at 5 C in a 39L rotor on a Spinco Model L ultracentrifuge. The tubes were punctured and the samples (about forty) were collected by the method of Martin &amp; Ames (1961). Enzyme concentration was determined by measuring absorption at 260 and 280 mu. For each tube the apparent molecular weights raised to two-thirds power were plotted against the fraction number (Martin &amp; Ames, 1961). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Purified fructose 1,6-diphosphatase (FDPase) from skeletal muscle of the Alaskan king crab appears as a single species in repeated electrofocusing experiments. The isoenzyme from warm 8-10 C acclimated animals has an isoelectric point (pI) of 5&#x7e;8-5&#x7e;9, and the isoenzyme from the cold-acclimated crabs has a pI value of 5&#x7e;3 (Fig. I). The warm isoenzyme of FDPase from muscle of the Alaskan king crab has been described previously (Behrisch, 1971, 1973) and shows the decline in apparent Km for substrate with a decrease n temperature that is idiomatic of many poikilothermic enzymes. The apparent K. for FDP falls with diminished temperature down to about 5 C, below which temperature the apparent K. rises to concentrations that would appear to exceed the known physiological concentrations of the substrate (Williamson et al., 1967). Subunits of seasonal isoenzymes 319 Similarly, the FDPase from the cold (winter) crabs Table 1. Comparisons of isoenzymes of fructose 1,6 exhibits a decline in apparent Km values for FDP diphosphatase from warm- and cold-acclimatized as temperature is decreased to -2 C (Fig. 2). Alaskan king crab As calculated by the method of Martin &amp; Ames (1961), king crab muscle FDPase has a molecular weight of about 135,000, a value that, predictably, 10 - pi= 5.9 worm FDPase T 06 a &#x7e;&apos; 04 &#x7e; 0.2 pI=5.3 110 cold FDPase x n pH gradient 8 6 nocp &#x7e; 1&apos;ID, 20 30 40 50 60 Fraction Number Fig. 1.

The crab FDPase can be dissociated into two &quot;halves&quot; each of about 65,000 to 66,500 mol. wt, by exposure to 4 M urea (Table 1). In this connection, Traniello et al. (1971) also report the dissociation of the FDPase from rabbit liver into &quot;halves&quot; by exposing it to acid conditions. These &quot;halves&quot; of crab FDPase display about 50 per cent of the activity of the native enzyme; dialysis of the ureatreated preparation resulted in recovery of 80 per cent of activity of the control.

Thus the 66,500 mol. wt subunit of the cold FDPase has a pI value of 525-530, a value considerably lower than the pI of 5&#x7e;9 of the 66,000 mol. wt subunit of the warm FDPase. One can conclude that the physical differences that (presumably) underlie the functional differences between the two isoenzyrtles are symmetrically arranged. Further treatment of the 66,000 mol. wt subunits with heat (55 C) or 2% sodium dedecyl sulfate (SDS) results in the total loss of catalytic activity (Table 1). In this context, Sia et al. (1969) and Grazi et al. (1973) report that exposure of rabbit liver FDPase &quot;halves&quot; to 1% SDS causes a dissociation of these subunits into yet smaller subunits (&quot;quarters&quot;) that are devoid of catalytic activity. Ultracentrifugation of the SDS-treated crab FDPase shows that the halves of the enzyme are dissociated by this treatment into two components of unequal weight, one of about 25,000 mol. wt and the other of about 40,000 mol. wt (Table 1). The enzyme thus appears to be made up of two pairs of subunits of unequal weight. Enzyme activity could not be recovered by incubation of these smaller fractions with each other. Subsequent electrofocusing of these smaller components-or subunitsshows that the larger of the two types (40,000 mol. wt) have the same pI value (4-7), whether they are 320 from the cold or warm FDPase isoenzyme (Table 1). This result suggests that the differences in the isoelectric points of the two isoenzymes reside in the smaller of the two SDS fractions. This is supported by electrofocusing experiments showing that the cold 25,000 mol. wt fraction has a pI value of 6&#x7e;1, while the homologous subunit from the warm FDPase has a pI value of around 6&#x7e;8. To be sure, it is unclear whether the two smaller (25,000 mol. wt) subunits of the FDPase molecule contain the catalytic site that exhibits the altered substrate affinity upon acclimatization to temperature, or if it is the change in the nature of these subunits that effects a conformational change in the total molecule. This would in turn modulate the thermal relationship of the FDPase-FDP interaction. In this connection, the 25,000 mol. wt subunit (pI 6&#x7e;1) could be a newly synthesized protein that, with the exception of a few key amino acid substitutions, is identical to the warm (pI 6&#x7e;8) 25,000 mol. wt. If this is the case, it is clear that the rate of formation of the new subunit must be balanced nicely with the rate of degradation of the old, now non-adaptive subunit. In this application, Katunuma et al. (1972) have identified three enzymes that specifically inactivate pyridoxal-, NAD-dependent and FADdependent enzymes in their apo-forms in various tissues of the rat. On the other hand, alteration of the subunits could involve a covalent interconversion by the attachment or detachment of functional groups in a manner similar to the metabolic interconversion of phosphorylase (Fischer et al., 1972), phosphorylase kinase (Krebs et al., 1972) and glycogen synthetase (Segal et al., 1972). Whichever, the present results suggest that instead of an entire new isoenzyme being formed, it may be only a small portion of this large (about 135,000 mol. wt) enzyme molecule that is altered during thermal acclimatization. This would confer on the organism energetic and possibly genetic economy combined with the environmental flexibility that is a requisite of poikilothermic life.
