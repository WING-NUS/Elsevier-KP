Introduction The determination of the radiologically important fallout nuclide &apos;Sr (t1.2 = 28.5 years) in milk is an important part of many national programmes for monitoring radioactivity in the environment &#x5b;1&#x5d;. Both this radionuclide and its daugh * Corresponding author. ter 9 Y (t1/2 = 64.4 h) are practically pure beta emitters and must be separated from the sample matrix prior to measurement. The classical separation scheme of Harley &#x5b;2&#x5d;, however, is difficult and time consuming so that there have been many attempts to develop simpler, faster methods. The present paper describes attempts to develop a solid phase extraction system for removing Sr from milk (or other liquids) with sufficient 0048-9697/95/&#x24;09.50 1995 Elsevier Science BV.

Tait et al. / The Science of the Total Environment 1731174 (1995) 159-167 capacity and specificity to avoid the drying, ashing, acid leaching, solvent extraction and precipitation stages of many techniques in current use. Sorption of diaza-crown ethers on silica with a view to binding alkali and alkaline earth cations from aqueous solutions has been previously described &#x5b;3&#x5d;. In addition, a solid phase extraction system with good specificity for Sr, based on ditertbutylcyclohexyl-8-crown-6 sorbed on beads of a polymer crosslinked with divinylbenzene &#x5b;4-6&#x5d;, is commercially available under the trade name Sr-Spec from EIChrom Industries Inc., Darien, IL, USA. However, we have found that these systems do not extract Sr directly from milk. Lehn and Sauvage &#x5b;7&#x5d; and Cox et al. &#x5b;8&#x5d; compared the stability constants and specificities of a large number of macrocyclic polyethers (crown ethers), bicyclic polyethers (cryptand) and other chelates with alkali and alkaline earth cations. They found that the most stable Sr complex was that formed in 95% methanol with the cryptand C222. The stability constant of the complex exceeds by six orders of magnitude that of the strongest Sr complex with a crown ether, namely that with dicyclohexyl-18-crown-6 (DC18C6). The specificity of C222 for Sr relative to cations such as Na&apos;, K+, Cs&apos; Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ was also greater than that of DC18C6. Since then there have been reports on the use of solutions of C222 in organic solvents in determinations of Sr in mixtures of different metal ions &#x5b;9-11&#x5d;. We therefore seek a solid support for this cryptand that does not inhibit its strong binding capacity and specificity for Sr. The two tertiary amino groups of C222 have pK values of 7.28 and 9.60 in water &#x5b;7&#x5d; and this property (i.e., protonation in acidic solution) has been used to bind Sr to the strongly acidic cation exchanger Dowex 50 WX8 &#x5b;12&#x5d;. These workers, however, did not investigate the capacity of the resulting material to bind Sr or other metal cations. The abilities to sorb C222 on this and other resins based on polystyrene crosslinked with divinylbenzene with and without cation exchange (sulphonate) or chelating groups (methylaminophosphonate, iminodiacetate, mercapto), or based on polyacrylic acid ester crosslinked with divinylbenzene, or sil ica gel were investigated in acidic, neutral and alkaline solutions in which the C222 exists predominantly as a dication, a monocation and as an uncharged molecule, respectively. Tracer studies with milk contaminated with &quot;Sr were carried out to determine the abilities of the resulting resins to sorb Sr from milk. For some of these systems conditions were optimised, e.g., pH, amount of Sr carrier, contact time, resin:milk ratio. Milk contains relatively large activities of naturally occurring radioactive &apos; K, Ca in large excess over Sr, activities of 137CS comparable to those of 9 Sr, and, after a release of radioactivity to the environment, 140Ba (t1/2 =12.75 days) and its daughter 140La (t1/2 = 40.27 h). As these cations might interfere with the determination of 9 Sr/ 9 Y their behaviour was also investigated by radiotracer techniques for the most promising system found so far. The possibility of direct liquid scintillation counting of 9 Sr/ 9 Y on resin saturated with scintillation cocktail was also investigated and is discussed. 2. Experimental Serva, Heidelberg, Germany, supplied: Amberlite XAD-2, -4, -7 and -8 as practical grade (XAD2 and -4 are polystyrene crosslinked with divinylbenzene, PS-DVB, while XAD-7 and -8 are acrylic acid ester and divinylbenzene copolymer), Serdolite AD-2, -4 and -7 as analytical grade (these correspond to the Amberlite XAD resins but are purified), the Chelites C, P and S as analytical grade (PS-DVB substituted with iminodicarboxylate, methylaminophoshonate and mercapto groups, respectively), Dowex 50 WX8, WX4 and WX2 as technical quality in the H+ form and as analytical grade in the Na&apos; form (these resins are PS-DVB with 8, 4, and 2% DVB, respectively, and contain strongly acidic sulphonate substituents). All these resins are beads with a particle diameter range of 0.3-0.9 mm, except that of the Chelite C beads which was 0.1-0.2 mm. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, supplied Silica gel Si-60 of particle size range 0.2-0.5 mm, Kryptofix 222 (cryptand C222 or 4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxa-1,10diazabicyclo&#x5b;8.8.8&#x5d;hexacosan) for synthesis quality D. Tait et al. / The Science of the Total Environment 173 1174 (1995) 159-167 (&gt; 99% purity) and all other reagents unless otherwise stated. All substances were used as received. 2.1. Treatment of resins with C222 Two hundred and sixty-six tLmol of Kryptofix 222 (C222) were dissolved in 10 ml acetonitrile to which was then added 40 ml of either 1 mol dm-3 HC1, H20 or 0.025 mol dm-3 aqueous Na2B407 (pH 10.6). Two ml wet volume of the resin under study were added and shaken with the mixture for 48 h. The amount of C222 sorbed on the resin was determined by measuring the change in the concentration of the C222 in the aqueous acetonitrile phase. The measurement technique depends on the reaction of C222 with Nessler&apos;s reagent to give an insoluble product which, at the small concentrations of C222 involved in this study, develops as a fine colloidal suspension over a period of 30-40 min prior to precipitation. The minimum value of light transmission at 700 nm is proportional to the concentration of C222. Ten to 50 Al of the aqueous acetonitrile solutions were therefore added to 0.3 ml of Nessler&apos;s reagent diluted in 2 ml deionised water in a 3-ml glass cuvette of path length 1 cm. Transmission in % (%T.i ) was measured at 700 nm with a UV/Vis. spectrophotometer until the minimum value was attained. The concentration of C222 was then obtained from a calibration plot prepared by measuring the %T.i. values of standards containing known amounts of C222 in aqueous acetonitrile. To obtain accurate results it is important that the volume of the sample aliquot used should be adjusted to give %Tmi. values in the range 45-95%. 2.2. Radiotracer studies The radiotracers 45Ca, &quot;Sr, 133Ba and 134CS were from Amersham Buchler, while 9&#x60; Sr/ 9 Y standard solution was from the PhysikalischTechnische Bundesanstalt, Braunschweig, Germany. 85 Sr, 133Ba and 134CS were monitored by gamma-spectrometry at 514, 356 and 604.7 keV with a GOLD detector (Canberra-Packard, Frankfurt/Main, Germany) of 21% efficiency (relative to 3&quot; x 3&quot; Nal crystall) and 2.0 keV resolution (FWHM) at 1330 keV, surrounded by lead shielding of 50 mm thickness. The gamma emission of 4 K at 1460.8 keV was monitored with a high purity Ge detector (also from Canberra-Packard) of 42% relative efficiency and 1.8 keV resolution. The detector and shielding material are of the low level type resulting in a relatively small background count rate at 1460.8 keV (0.0002 s-1). &quot;Ca was monitored by liquid scintillation counting in a Tri-Carb 2260 XL low-level liquid scintillation spectrometer with Instant Scint Gel Plus as scintillation cocktail (spectrometer and cocktail both from Canberra-Packard, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). All radioactivity measurements were continued until the relative uncertainty of the net count rate was less than 2%, except for measurements of 40K for which relative uncertainties of up to 10% were accepted. 3. Results Table 1 shows that the resins that sorbed C222 did so most strongly under neutral conditions, in the order Dowex 50 &gt;&gt; Chelite S &gt; Chelite C =Silica gel Si-60 &gt; Chelite P &gt;&gt; Serdolite AD-4 - AD-7. The unusually large value for Dowex 50 was determined by mixing the same 2-ml sample of resin with successive 50-ml portions of C222 solution in aqueous acetonitrile. The Amberlites XAD-2, -4, -7 and -8 did not sorb detectable amounts of C222, and are not shown in the table. Dowex 50 WX4 reacted similarly to 50 WX8, while sorption by Dowex 50 WX2 was somewhat weaker. Both Dowex 50 and Serdolit AD-4 sorbed C222 more strongly from acid than from alkaline solution. Only Serdolite AD-2 sorbed C222 more strongly from alkaline than from neutral solution. Removal of Sr from milk by the resin system with the greatest capacity for binding C222 was investigated by contaminating 100-ml milk samples with &quot;Sr and stirring with 2-ml wet volumes of Dowex 50 WX8 loaded with 25-2000 Amol C222. Fig. 1 shows that sorption of Sr from the milk increased with C222 loading up to 200 pmol per 2 ml resin, while loadings greater than this did not improve sorption of Sr by the resin. 162 D.

It might be expected that resins containing cation exchange or chelating groups should show considerable binding of Sr from milk even in the absence of C222. Fig. 2 therefore compares the sorption of Sr from 100-ml milk samples by 2-ml wet volumes of untreated resins and by those containing C222. The loadings of C222 on the resins correspond to the values given in Table 1 for the treatment of resin with neutral solutions of C222, except for Dowex 50 WX8 which contained 266 gmol C222. The C222-treated resins sorbed Sr from milk in the order Dowex 50-C222 = Chelite S-C222 &gt; Silica gel Si-60-C222 &gt; Chelite P-C222 &gt; Chelite C-C222; sorption by the first three of these systems is several-fold greater than sorption by the corresponding untreated resin. The largest difference in Sr sorption is seen between the Si-60-C222 and the Q 3 Fig. 1. Sorption of 85Sr from milk as a function of C222 content.

The Chelite S-C222 system was therefore studied further. Figs. 3 and 4 show that the maximum efficiency of Sr sorption from milk is already attained at a loading of 133 Amol of C222 on 2 ml wet volume of Chelite S and at neutral pH. Values of pH less than 6 were not studied because under such conditions milk protein may precipitate and interfere with the results. Sr carrier in the range 0.5-10 mg/l milk influences the sorption of Sr only slightly (see Fig. 5). Although the content of natural Sr in milk is usually in the range 300-500 ,Ag/l, regional peculiarities may lead to concentrations of up to 5 mg/l &#x5b;13&#x5d;. The results in Fig. 5 indicate that the amounts of Chelite S-C222 used here should efficiently sorb such unusually large natural Sr contents. Varying temperature in the range 25-70 C did not significantly influence the sorption of Sr from 100-ml samples of milk by 2 ml wet volume of Chelite S containing 133 Amol C222. Table 2 shows the results of studies on the sorption of K, Ca, Cs and Ba from milk by Chelite S-C222. The true value for Ca is probably considerably smaller than that given in the table because the observed count rate of 45Ca tracer in the milk samples after treatment with Chelite D.

No Sr carrier added. 100 ml milk containing 134 Cs, successive washes with one 35-ml and three 10-ml portions of the Cs carrier solution removed respectively 91.2, 96.0, 98.7 and 99.6% of the Cs from the resin, i.e., less than 0.04% of the t34Cs initially added to the milk remained on the resin after the last wash, representing a decontamination factor of about 2.4 x 103. Continuous elution of the Chelite S-C222 in a column removed Cs more efficiently as shown in Fig. 6: the decontamination factor (relative to the initial milk) is 2.8 x 104 after elution with 35 Tait et ai: /The Science of the Total Environment 1731174 (1995) 159-167 ml of 10 mg/ml Cs carrier. K+, Sr 2+ and Ba2+ are not removed by this process nor by washing with deionised water or 2 mol dm-3 NaOH, implying that these three cations are strongly bound to the C222 on the resin. Since the Sr may have to be further isolated in preparation for beta-counting, systems for removing Sr from Chelite S-C222 were investigated. Fig. 7 shows the elution of Sr from columns of Chelite S-C222 with either 5 mol dm-3 HN03, 2 mol dm-3 HCl or 20% (V/V) acetonitrile in 1 mol dm-3 HCI. Neither 0.1 mol dm3 acetate buffer (pH 4) nor 0.1 mol dm-3 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 1 mol dm-3 NaOH removed Sr efficiently. The possibility of measuring 9 Sr/ 9 Y directly on the Chelite S-C222 resin was also studied as follows: 1 1 of milk was contaminated with 9 Sr/ &apos; Y standard solution and treated with 20 ml wet volume of resin for 48 h. The resin was separated, washed thoroughly with deionised water, dried at 90 C then transferred to a 25-ml glass scintillation vial. Instant Scint Gel Plus was added until the resin was saturated with cocktail. However, liquid scintillation measurements showed that the preparation was strongly quenched and counting efficiency was poor.

Elution of residual 134Cs from 2 ml wet volume Chelite S containing 133 Wmol C222 with aqueous CsCl (10 mg Cs/ml). Conditions: 100 ml milk contaminated with 134Cs was stirred for 48 h with the 2 ml Chelite S-C222. The resin was transferred to a column of diameter 7 mm and eluted with aqueous Cs carrier at a flow rate of 1 m/min. Fig. 7. Elution of 85Sr from 2 ml Chelite C containing 133 umol C222 which had been used for sorbing the Sr from milk. Eluants: O 20% acetonitrile in 1 mol dm-3 HCl; A 2 mol dm-3 HCI; E 5 mol dm-3 HN03. Flow rate was 1 ml min-1. Column diameter was 7 mm. the resin with more than a certain amount of C222 does not increase the sorption of Sr from milk. This implies that not all C222 binding sites on the resin can compete with Sr binding in the milk. Clearly, PS-DVB resins with cation exchange or chelating groups bind greater amounts of C222 than similar resins without such groups, e.g., Serdolite AD-7. As the ability of Serdolite AD-C222 systems to sorb Sr from milk has not yet been tested, it is not clear if the cation exchange or chelating groups are needed for Sr binding. Of the PS-DVB resins, the largest increase in Sr sorption from milk induced by C222 was observed for Chelite S. Furthermore, the Chelite S-C222 system removes Sr more efficiently from milk than the Dowex 50-C222. Fig. 2 shows equal sorption of Sr by the two resin/C222 systems, but in these experiments the C222 content of Dowex 50 WX8 is twice that of the Chelite S system. Non-specific binding of many other metal cations by the supporting resin is also likely to be stronger for Dowex 50 WX8 than for Chelite S. Therefore, treating Chelite S with small amounts of C222 provides a promising material for selectively binding Sr isotopes from milk. The relatively long times required to attain equilibrium (24-48 h) may be compensated by the ease 166 D. Tait et al /The Science of the Total Environment 173/174 (1995)159-167 0 cocktail + aqueous solution channel no. Fig. 8.

Thus, after equilibration, the milk is decanted and discarded, the resin is transferred to a column and washed with 10 mg/ml Cs carrier to remove milk traces and minimise contamination of the Sr with Cs radioisotopes. Under the conditions used so far, 6% of the natural 40K of the milk remain sorbed on the resin, however. As milk contains about 50 Bq of 4 K/l, about 3 Bq remain on the resin for each litre of milk treated. This amount would interfere with the measurement of the much smaller activities of 9o Sr/ 9 Y usually present in milk. As expected from the published stability constants for the complexes with C222, the separation of Ba from Sr is also poor, i.e., 140Ba/ 140 La would interfere if the milk were contaminated with fresh fallout. Perhaps selective elution procedures may improve the separation of K and Ba from Sr. It may also be possible to remove these elements from the milk with selective complexing agents prior to treatment with Chelite S-C222. Alternatively, a purification step such as stirring with Mn02 &#x5b;14&#x5d; could be carried out after elution of the Sr from the resin. Such an elution step is necessary in any case because I Sr/ 90 Y cannot be counted on the Chelite S-C222 directly. In view of the volumes of eluant required in the examples in Fig. 7, the Sr would have to be concentrated, e.g., by precipitation prior to beta-counting. Attempts are being made to find more efficient as well as more Srspecific elution systems. Although Silica gel Si-60-C222 is less efficient than Chelite S-C222 in sorbing Sr from milk (see Fig. 2), it has some advantages over this system. For example, non-specific binding to the Si02 matrix is probably insignificant for most metal cations. Furthermore 90 Sr/ 9 Y on the dried resin in contact with scintillation cocktail can be efficiently measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry (Fig. 8). The size of the milk sample that can be handled by this method depends on both the amount of resin which fits in the scintillation vial and on the efficiency of Sr sorption by the resin-C222 system. Therefore, if sufficient iso- D. Tait et al. /The Science of the Total Environment 1731174 (1995) 159-167 167 topic purity is attainable, this system could provide a very simple procedure for determining 9 Sr/ 9 Y in milk samples of volume up to about 600-700 ml. Work is continuing to find similar resin systems with greater Sr sorption efficiency and specificity and which can be measured directly by liquid scintillation counting.
