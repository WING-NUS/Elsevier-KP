ABSTRACT

If information science is to be considered a "science" in the true sense of the word, there
is a clear need for the development of a set of general concepts and analytical expressions
regarding the flow of information in any situation for which information serves as a re-
source. This paper discusses quantitative aspects of a theory leading to the development of
such a pragmatic information theory. At the heart of a theory of pragmatic information is
the measure of information contained in a set of data. At the pragmatic level, information
has value to the extent that it is useful as a resource for purposeful activity. The primary
"purposeful activity" in life is decision-making. Hence, information and decision-making
are inextricably tied together; in fact, information is data of value in decision-making. In
this paper, we discuss quantitatively a very general decision model which provides a formal
and comprehensive representation of uncertainty in decision-making. Other decision models
presented in the literature assume away a considerable and important portion of the uncer-
tainty that exists in decision-making. This model is then used as a framework for examining
the role of information in decision-making in a way that is also formal and comprehensive.
Hence, the decision model suggested facilitates a meaningful analysis of information; this
analysis culminates in the development of a measure of the value of the pragmatic informa-
tion contained in a set of data.

1. INTRODUCTION

a theory would include fundamental relationships, measures, and quantitative
expressions about information flow in any situation for which information serves
as a resource. In this theoretical development we relate information to decision-
making. Accordingly, one of the objectives of this approach is to establish prin-
ciples and guidelines regarding the use of information in decision processes.

Weaver [4] has suggested a three-fold classification of the communications
problems of interest in information science: (1) the technical problem; (2) the
semantic problem; and (3) the effectiveness (or behavioral) problem. Problems
at the first level are well in hand. The significance of Shannon's work [4] on
communication theory is, of course, widely recognized. The treatment of prob-
lems at the second level has been somewhat less complete than the treatment of
those at the first level; nevertheless, significant and quite widely accepted work
of a fundamental nature (e.g., by such people as Carnap and Bar-Hillel [5],
Winograd [6], and others) does exist. However, no comprehensive and widely
accepted theory of information at the third level has yet been published, despite
its clear significance.

The effectiveness or behavioral problem involves an investigation of the use
and effect of information on human activity. Studies in this area involve the re-
lationship between information, communication processes, and human behav-
ioral activities. A comprehensive theory dealing with communications problems
at this third level would consist, in part, of situation-dependent and time-
dependent measures of the effect of information on any activity for which infor-
mation serves as a resource. Furthermore, it would contain fundamental expres-
sions regarding the flow of information in any such situation. Using the termi-
nology of the linguist, we may refer to such a theory as a theory of pragmatic
information.

In this paper, we discuss quantitatively a generalized decision model which
provides a formal and comprehensive representation of uncertainty in decision-
making. This model is then used as a framework for examining the role of infor-
mation in decision-making in a way that is also formal and comprehensive.
Hence, the generalized decision model facilitates a meaningful analysis of infor-
mation, culminating in the development of a measure of the value of the prag-
matic information contained in a set of data.

2.BACKGROUND

At the pragmatic level, the primary activity for which information serves as a
resource is decision-making. Information is used for making decisions; it is ac-
quired, processed, and disseminated for this very reason. Hence, information
and decision-making are inextricably tied together. Indeed, information can be
defined as data of value in decision-making. In [1 ] and [2], one of the authors
has discussed the basis for such a definition as well as the implications thereof.

Fig. 1. The generalized information system model.

In particular, this definition gives rise to the generalized information system
model depicted in Fig. 1. This model is a perfectly general one, limited only by
three basic hypotheses.

The first hypothesis is that there is a close interrelationship between informa-
tion and decision-making; this interrelationship gives rise to the definition of in-
formation stated. The second hypothesis is related to the ability to measure or
quantify information or even to know of its existence. In the physical world,
the only way in which a real parameter, say a mass or a force, can be measured,
is by its interaction with the environment. If this interaction does not exist,
then it is impossible, almost by definition, to measure a quantity or even to es-
tablish its existence. One ought to be able to make the same statement about in-
formation. It is necessary that the information produce physical interaction-
with the real world. In any real situation it must give rise to an observable
effect. The third hypothesis which the model is to satisfy is the necessity that
the decision-maker must have some way of comparing predicted observables with
the actual observables that result from any decision for which he is responsible.
The decision-maker generates a course of action which he believes will have cer-
tain observable effects. It is only after comparing the actual observables with
those he has predicted, that he has some way of verifying the validity of his
course of action. In other words, the third hypothesis dictates that the general-
ized model must have feedback between the resulting observables and the
decision-maker.

In a recent paper [3], the authors provide further refinement and extension
for some of the relationships suggested in [1] and [2]. In [3], a new and quite
general decision model was developed; such a decision model was necessary pri-
marily because existing decision models do not provide a comprehensive rep-
resentation of uncertainty. Specifically, the group to whom typical decision
models (as found in voluminous form in the decision theoretic literature) are
addressed consists of decision-makers who are assumed to have reached a rather

174

BRUCE J. WHITTEMORE AND M. C. YOVITS

advanced state of knowledge about the decision situation in questioni.e.,
decision-makers who have already resolved a considerable amount of uncertainty.
This shortcoming is important because a formal and comprehensive analysis of
the role of information in decision-making can only be founded on a decision
model that provides a formal and comprehensive representation of uncertainty in
decision-making.

In other words, the decision theoretic literature which exists in voluminous
form treats the situation where the decision-maker already has a high degree of
expertise. On the other hand, the information science aspects of decision theory
must cover comprehensively those decision-makers who not only are expert, but
those decision-makers who may be mediocre or even rather poor. A large part
of the development of information systems is clearly aimed at the non-expert or
even the novice decision-maker. It is, therefore, most important in developing a
formal role for information science that all levels of effectiveness of decision-
makers be considered.

In [3] we point out that a decision-maker (DM) must contend (either con-
sciously or unconsciously) with two fundamental types of uncertainty: struc-
tural uncertainty and relational uncertainty. The DM must first attempt to
identify the basic structure of the situation: the nature and number of elements
involved. Given some representation of this basic structure (albeit incomplete
or even totally incorrect), the DM can then attempt to assess the nature of the
relationships between these elements.

At the same time another categorization of uncertainty exists. It is seen from
Fig. 1 that the execution of courses of action results in observable outcomes; yet
there is executional uncertainty associated with predicting exactly which out-
come will occur when a given action is executed. Furthermore, deciding which
course of action to select involves consideration of the relative desirability of
possible decision outcomes; this "relative desirability" can be determined only
by addressing goal uncertainty. Finally, the state of the external environment

(or "state of nature") often plays an important role in decisions; hence, the DM
must also contend with environmental uncertainty.

In general then, uncertainty in decision-making can be classified in two pos-
sible ways. Uncertainty may be structural or relational in nature; at the same
time, it may be executional, environmental, or goal associated. This classifica-
tion of uncertainty is depicted in Fig. 2.

The conceptual decision model suggested in Reference [3] is a general one: a
structure consisting of courses of action, decision outcomes, values of decision
outcomes, and states of nature as well as the associated sources of uncertainty.
The conceptual model is depicted schematically in Fig. 3.

3. ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION

Consider a DM who is required to make a sequence of related choices from
among a discrete set of alternatives A = {ai, a-i,    , aJ. Since the DM
may be uncertain about the nature and number of elements in this set, m may
not be a fixed and/or known constant. The execution of a particular course of
action results in the occurrence of one of a set of possible outcomes 0 =
{oi, o-i,    , On}. To allow for unexpected outcomes, n should also be inter-
preted as variable over time. The DM may be uncertain as to the relationship be-

tween a particular course of action a, and an outcome o/. The likelihood that
the execution of course of action a, will result in outcome o, can be denoted by
the subjective probabilistic estimate wy. This is indicated in Fig. 4.

After a DM has determined his overall goal structure (i.e., to what goal he
aspires), he must then assign numbers (in terms of value units) to the various de-
cision outcomes that reflect the relative value of these outcomes with respect to
goal attainment. These relative values are denoted by { u(oy)}; the execution
matrix now becomes that depicted in Fig. 5.

The set of relevant states of nature can be denoted by S = {xi, Si,    , Sr}.
As with m and n, r is also interpreted as a number whose value may vary accord-
ing to the DM's current understanding of the decision situation. The probabili-
ties of occurrence for the various states of nature can be denoted by the subjec-
tive estimates P(si),P(s-t),    ,P{Sr).

The values of the probabilities w,y and P(sk) depend on the DM's current
understanding of the situation. In general, this understanding changes over time;

nevertheless, at any one point in time at which the DM is required to use his de-
cision model to make a decision, m, n, and r assume whatever values reflect his
current understanding of the situation. Hence, at any particular point in time
S}Li w = 1 ; = 1, 2,    , m and S^i P(^) = l.

The decision elements A, O, {n'iy}, and [u(o,)} are clearly dependent upon
the state of the external environment. These dependencies can be incorporated
as follows: the sets A and 0 can be defined so as to reflect the DM's current
understanding of all possible courses of action and all possible decision out-
comes for all states of nature. A set of {wf,} and {u^ (o,)} can be assumed to
exist for each state of nature s^. The suggested mathematical representation is
depicted in Fig. 6.

The mathematical decision model suggested here consists of this decision ma-
trix together with an appropriate decision rule which results in the selection of a
single course of action.

The exact nature of this decision rule is dependent upon the decision-maker's
personal attitude. For example, if the DM is rather conservative, he might
choose to select that course of action which maximizes his minimum possible

gain. For illustrative purposes, assume that the DM selects an alternative on the
basis of maximum expected (relative) value. That is, he selects a*, such that

It is important to note that nothing yet indicated is really dependent upon
the type of decision rule which the decision-maker may use. This decision rule
may be totally a descriptive one, or it may be a normative rule of any type, or it
may be a combination of the two. The above equations are representative only
and suggest a specific decision rule that one might apply. It is, however, a very
reasonable rule and one that it is convenient to consider in somewhat more detail
later.

The generalized decision model discussed above provides a framework for ex-
amining the role of information in decision-making in a way that is formal, com-
prehensive, and meaningful. Let us begin this examination and analysis by con-
sidering the separate effects of information on the various types of uncertainty;

we will then consider the aggregated effect.

The information contained in a set of data (either unexpected new data from
the external environment or feedback data from past decisions) has either struc-
tural value or relational value or both. If the data indicate to the DM that his
understanding of the structural components of the decision situation is incom-
plete and/or incorrect, then these data contain structural information. On the
other hand, data that help the DM refine his model of the relationships that exist
between known structural components contain relational information. These
concepts are elaborated on at length in [3].

Consider the DM who has resolved a certain amount of structural uncertainty;

i.e., he has a rather good idea as to his decision goals, the available courses of
action, the possible decision outcomes, and the relevant states of nature. The
DM's current lists of mutually exclusive courses of action, decision outcomes,
and states of nature can be made exhaustive by the addition of a "catch-all
category" in each case. For example, if the DM can identify n - 1 possible de-
cision outcomes, then o represents "the occurrence of some other, unexpected
outcome." Similarly, alternative dm denotes "any other course of action" and
state Sr denotes "any other relevant state of nature." Here the role of relational
information (either new information from the external environment or feedback
information) can be discussed in rather precise quantitative terms.

Initially, a DM who is completely uncertain about the execution of a particu-

QUANTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION                      179

lar course of action a;' given state of nature s^' has "insufficient reason" to as-
sume anything other than that the various decision outcomes are equally prob-
able; i.e., w^- = \jn for  = 1, 2,    , n. Of course, the use of the principle of in-
sufficient reason can only follow from the DM's acceptance of certain underlying
axioms. Luce and Raiffa [7] discuss these axioms in detail. For act a,' and
state Sk' then, such a distribution reflects a state of complete indeterminism.
Any change in this distribution can occur only as a result of utilizing relational-
executional information. If the DM has prior information about the execution
of alternative a,' given state x^', the associated distribution would, of course, in-
dicate this by reflecting something other than a state of indeterminism. If there
is no executional uncertainty associated with a,', then a state of determinism
would be reflected by one of the w^'j elements being unity and all others being
zero.

In general then, at time t the DM has a set {Pf(o, |a,;Sfe')} of n probabilistic
estimates regarding the occurrence of observable decision outcome Oy given that
course of action a,' is selected and state of nature s^' prevails. Specifically,

Pt (o, la,' ; Sk ) = w^', for  = 1, 2,    , n.                (3.3)

New data or feedback data that contain relational-executional information must
in some way affect this distribution.

Numerous schemes exist for combining new and old information. Recent
papers by Fu [8] and Tsypkin [9] provide a survey of these "learning algo-
rithms." Clearly, whether a particular scheme for combining new and old infor-
mation is "best" depends entirely on the characteristics of the particular situa-
tion at hand. Nevertheless, one learning rule discussed by Fu [8], and in more
detail by Bush and Mosteller [10] and Fu and McLaren [11 ], is particularly
well suited for use in conjunction with the generalized decision model.

If the underlying stochastic process that governs the execution of course of
action a,' given state of nature s^' is assumed to be stationary or at least quasi-
stationary (i.e., stationary over certain intervals of time), then the effect of
relational-executional information on the probabilities [Pt(o, |a;'; Sfe')} can be
described mathematically by the following linear reinforcement learning rule:

P^(o,\a,';Sk'}=\Pt(o,\a,;Sk')+(.ï - X)P^';a,-;o/),      (3.4)

where /^(sfc';a/';o,) represents the probability at time t of the joint occurrence
of s fc', Ok, and oy. By the multiplication rule that results from the definition of
conditional probability,

P^;a,;o,)=P,(Sk')Pt'(ai'\s,')P,(o,\Sh';a,'),           (3.5)

which can be readily computed since, from the decision model, Pt(Sk') ::P(sk')
and Pt(oj\Sic',aj') = w^'j and since P( (a;' \s^') can be defined as the conditional

The value of X is such that O &lt; X &lt; l, although typically O &lt; À &lt; l.

This parameter may be interpreted in two different, but intuitively consistent
ways. First, X is a learning parameter; a larger value of À results in a slower learn-
ing rate, while a smaller value of X results in a more rapid rate of learning.
Secondly, À can be viewed as a parameter whose value reflects the DM's confi-
dence in his current representation of uncertainty. As such, this value also re-
flects the weight the DM is willing to give his prior representation of uncertainty
in combining this old information with new information in order to obtain a new
representation of uncertainty.

The relative value of outcome o, given that the state of nature is s^:' is given
by u^ (oy). This number represents the relative desirability of outcome o/ to the
DM. As the DM increases his understanding of the decision situation, he may be
able to assess more accurately the relative values of the possible decision out-
comes. The DM can incorporate relational-goal information by changing the ap-
propriate relative values of these outcomes so that they reflect his current under-
standing of the situation.

Now consider the DM's representation of relational-environmental uncer-
tainty: the subjective (in general) probability distribution of the states of nature,
P(si), P(si),   , P(Sr). What is the effect on this distribution of the actual se-
lection of a given alternative a,' and the execution of this alternative into out-
come Oy'? If the underlying stochastic process can reasonably be assumed to be
stationary, it is well known that it provides an optimal method for combining
prior, subjective information with such new, objective data (i.e., data which con-
tain feedback information). Noting that w^' is actually the likelihood that Oy'
will result from act a;' given that the state of nature is s^, the following applica-
tion of Bayes' theorem gives a precise representation of the role of feedback in-
formation here :

In general, decision-makers do not make decisions on the basis of what the
decision situation actually is, but rather on the basis of what they think the situ-
ation is. Here the notion of an "information structure," as defined by Marschak
[12], adds some operational significance to this conceptual notion. Part of the
function of an information system is to diagnose the state of nature. If Z =
{zi, z .z,    , Zy] denotes the set of diagnostic signals about the states Si, s-i,   
   ,Sf, then the q^ elements in Marschak's information structure represent the
probability that the information system will emit signal Zy given that x; is the
true state of nature. Hence, the (jr,y are likelihoods, and a straightforward appli-
cation of Bayes' theorem can describe precisely the effect of this diagnostic in-
formation on the DM:

It is important to recognize that the learning rules discussed above are only
suggestive and/or illustrative of what a reasonable DM might, or in some cases,
should do. The way in which a particular DM actually uses information to revise
or reinforce his current understanding of the decision situation is, of course, a
highly individualistic process. Hence, the learning rules suggested here are only
meant to be examples of ways in which a DM's representation of uncertainty
might be revised or reinforced. The fact that the decision model suggested here
is amenable to the application of these and other learning rules is clearly an indi-
cation of its generality.

Although the separate effects of the various types of information are clearly
important, they are really only of major significance in their combined effect on
the DM's understanding of the situation. The amount or value of the informa-
tion contained in a set of data cannot be meaningfully expressed except in terms
of how these data affect the DM's model of the decision situation. One of the
purposes of this study is to suggest a measure of pragmatic information that sub-
sumes any possible measure of amount of information in that it is, in fact, a mea-
sure of the value of an amount of information.

Information has value in decision-making to the extent that it changes the
DM's state of knowledge about a decision situation or, to use MacKay's [13]
terminology, his "state of conditional readiness" for making that decision. The
generalized decision model provides the means by which this notion of a deci-
sion state can be readily represented.

Regardless of what decision rule a DM is utilizing, it is possible to obtain a dis-
tribution that reflects his overall inclination toward the various courses of action.
For example, as we have already considered, if the DM is an expected value
maximizer, he will select course of action a* according to Eqs. (3.1) and (3.2).

bilities of choice regarding the m courses of action. Notice that these probabili-
ties of choice are dependent upon all the components of the generalized decision
model; specifically, the effects of any of the six types of uncertainty depicted in
Fig. 2 are manifested in this one distribution. Consequently, the extent to which
information reduces any of these six types of uncertainty will be reflected in this
distribution. Assuming the DM has resolved sufficient structural uncertainty to
enumerate an exhaustive list of courses of action (by inserting a "catch-all alter-
native," if necessary), then the expression (originally suggested by Ackoff [14])

Specifically, if each PCa,) = l lm, then the DM has no basis for choice and the
value of the expression is zero. At the other extreme, if one of the probabilities
of choice is unity and all others are zero, then the situation is completely deter-
mined and the value of the expression is maximal:

The value V of the decision state DS at time f is a function of the probabili-
ties {Pt(cij)} and can be defined by

(3.14)

If the decision state is completely indeterminate (i.e., the DM has no information
on which to base a choice), then V(DSf) = 0; if the state is completely deter-

minate (i.e., the DM has no uncertainty whatsoever about which alternative to
select), then V(DSt) = 1.

The probabilities of choice {P( (a,)} which define the decision state at time ;

are functions of the various components of the decision model. Specifically,
from equations (3.2) and (3.10)

h=l         h=ï fc=l      =!

(For the sake of clarity, the t subscripts on the P(sic), w^., and uk (o,) are
omitted.) The treatment of all the types of uncertainty depicted in Fig. 2 is re-
flected in these probabilities of choice {P, (a,)}. Information has its impact on
the various components of the decision model. Consequently, the pragmatic in-
formation / contained in a set of data D can be defined by the impact of these
data on the value of the DM's decision state:

I(D)=V(DS^)- V(DS,).                (3.16)

Equation (3.16) says that the pragmatic information content of a set of data
or a message is equal to the difference of the value of the decision state of the
decision-maker after and before receipt of the message, where the value of the
decision state is a function of the determinism of the decision maker. Many dif-
ferent approaches may be used to determine the decision state, either descrip-
tively or analytically. However, in our suggested formulation this is obtained
directly from Eqs. (3.14) and (3.15).

4. CONCLUSION

In information science there is a need for the development of a theory of
pragmatic information. Such a theory would relate information to its use and
usefulness in choice situations; it would treat information as a resource whose
value is relative. At the heart of such a theory would be a measure of the prag-
matic information content of a message for a particular decision-maker in a par-
ticular decision situation at a particular point in time.

The measure defined in equation (3.16) is suggested as such a measure and is,
therefore, thought to be of major importance. Some additional implications of
this measure are suggested in [3]. In general, this measure quantifies informa-
tion in terms of its effect on the state of the decision-maker. A decision state is
defined so that it represents a complete quantitative description of the DM's cur-
rent understanding of a decision situation. The detailed development of this
measure is the primary contribution of this study to information science.

					<ce:simple-para view="all">If information science is to be considered a “science” in the true sense of the word, there is a clear need for the development of a set of general concepts and analytical expressions regarding the flow of information in any situation for which information serves as a resource. This paper discusses quantitative aspects of a theory leading to the development of such a 
						<ce:italic>pragmatic information theory</ce:italic>. At the heart of a theory of pragmatic information is the measure of information contained in a set of data. At the pragmatic level, information has value to the extent that it is useful as a resource for purposeful activity. The primary “purposeful activity” in life is decision-making. Hence, information and decision-making are inextricably tied together; in fact, 
						<ce:italic>information is data of value in decision-making</ce:italic>. In this paper, we discuss quantitatively a very general decision model which provides a formal and comprehensive representation of uncertainty in decision-making. Other decision models presented in the literature assume away a considerable and important portion of the uncertainty that exists in decision-making. This model is then used as a framework for examining the role of information in decision-making in a way that is also formal and comprehensive. Hence, the decision model suggested facilitates a meaningful analysis of information; this analysis culminates in the development of a measure of the value of the pragmatic information contained in a set of data.
