ABSTRACT

This paper presents a survey of some recent results in the fields of nonlinear filtering and
stochastic control resulting from the use of Gaussian sum approximations to certain density
functions. When trying to estimate and control the state of a nonlinear stochastic dynamic
system from noisy measurement data, the a posteriori density of the state conditioned on
the measurement data contains all of the available information about the system state. If
these densities were available, it should be possible to develop "optimal" estimation and
control policies. The well-known Bayesian recursion relations describe the evolution of
this a posteriori density in terms of given a priori densities, the system dynamics and
measurement equations and the available data. Unfortunately, it is seldom possible to
solve these closed forms for the required a posteriori densities. Over the last few years
it has been shown that when the a priori densities are approximated by a sum of Gaussian
densities with positive weighting coefficients that linear non-Gaussian problems can be
solved analytically and that new natural solutions to nonlinear problems are available.
Recently this method has been extended to dual deterministic optimal control problems.

1. INTRODUCTION

It has been known for some time that in order to model many physical,
chemical, biological, and other systems adequately one must use mathematical
models which take into account the stochastic nature of the systems under
consideration. Such systems can seldom be observed in such a way that the
total system behavior or state is known precisely at all times. Rather, the
system is observed through measurement of variables which yield incomplete
information and which contain unknown or random errors. In order to study
the systems behavior or to control that behavior, it is generally necessary to
estimate, from the contaminated measurement data and the stochastic dy-
namical system equations, the state of the system and certain unknown param-
eters of the system. In addition it is frequently necessary to take some type of
control action based on these estimates.

The problem of finding an optimal control policy based on some performance
criteria involves, except for certain simple cases, a complex combination of the

estimation problem and the control performance criterion. However, the estima-
tion problem can be considered separately from the control problem and, in this
sense, is the simpler of the two.

The problem of estimating the state of a nonlinear stochastic system from
noisy measurement data has been the subject of considerable research interest
during the past few years, but, although a great deal has been published on the
subject, the basic objective of obtaining a solution that can be implemented in a
straightforward manner for specific applications has not been satisfactorily
realized. This is manifested by the fact that the Kalman filter equations [1,2],
which are valid only for linear, Gaussian systems, continue to be widely used for
nonlinear, non-Gaussian systems. Of course, continued application has resulted
in the development of ad hoc techniques [3-5] that have improved the perfor-
mance of the Kalman filter and which give it some of the characteristics of non-
linear filters.

However, as more and more emphasis is placed on optimum system perfor-
mance, the available estimation and control policies for inherently stochastic sys-
tems must be improved. As the system models improve and computers with
greater capability become available, it will be necessary to develop techniques
which utilize all pertinent existing information to obtain such policies. The
ability to utilize all of the information contained in non-Gaussian densities and
to propagate this through nonlinear plants will be essential for this purpose.

Central to the nonlinear estimation and stochastic control problems is the
determination of the probability density function of the state conditioned on
the available measurement data. This density contains all information which is
theoretically available concerning the state of the system. Thus, if this a
posteriori density function were known, an estimate of the state of any per-
formance criterion could be determined. Unfortunately, although the manner
in which the density evolves with time and additional measurement data can be
described in terms of difference (or differential) equations, these relations are
generally very difficult to solve, either in closed-form or numerically, so that it
is usually impossible to determine the a posteriori density for specific applica-
tions. Because of this difficulty, it is natural to investigate the possibility of
approximating the density with some tractable form. One approach to the solu-
tion of this problem and some results which have been obtained are discussed
below.

2. RECURSIVE NONLINEAR FILTERING: THE BAYESIAN APPROACH

This paper briefly summarizes the results obtained in the field of nonlinear
filtering and stochastic control by use of the Gaussian sum approximation to
certain density functions. This work is all based on the Bayesian [6] approach
and is therefore limited by the assumption of the existence of the probability

density functions used below. Except for the case of linear systems with
Gaussian noise but possibly non-Gaussian a priori densities discussed in Sec. 3,
all work on nonlinear filtering based on this method has been concerned with
the discrete time model given below.

Suppose that the state vector Xfc of the system evolves according to the non-
linear stochastic difference equation:

Xk,i =ffc,i(xfc)+Wfc fc=0,l,...,^V-1,            (1)

where \iç is the n-dimensional state of the system at the time t/c, Wfc is the n-
dimensional plant random noise vector and where the initial state Xg is a ran-
dom variable with a known density function p(xo). In addition the white noise
sequence w'' = (WQ, Wi,... , w^) has a known probability density function
p(wfc) =p(wo)p(wi ),..., p(Wfc), which is independent of the initial state.

The behavior of the plant is observed imperfectly through measurement
quantities z^ that are related in a prescribed fashion to the state but which
contain random errors.

Zfc=hfc(Xk)+Vfc; fe=0,l,...,M               (2)

where z^ is the w-dimensional measurement vector of known measurement data
at the time t^, and v^ is the m-dimensional measurement noise vector con-
taminating the data at tic. The noise sequence v'^ A (vo, Vi,... , Vfc) is assumed
to be a white-noise sequence with a known distribution p^) and to be inde-
pendent of the initial state and all plant noise. The restriction to additive noise
terms is not necessary but reduces the complexity of two of the densities
required for the Bayesian recursion relations given below.

Since the state vector Xk is a random variable, in the probablistic context of
this discussion, the a posteriori density p(xfc|z'c) provides the most complete
description possible ofx^. This density is determined recursively from the
Bayesian recursion relations given below. The filtering density is given first and
the prediction density is next.

The densities p(Zfc|Xfc) andp(Xfc|Xfe_i) are determined from (l) and (2), and the
a priori densities for v^ and v/ic-i.

The nonlinear filtering problem is solved when the density p (x^lz^) can be
obtained for all k, however, except when the system (1)-(2) is linear and the a
priori distributions are Gaussian, it is generally impossible to determine pCx^i1')
in a closed form using (3)-(5). In the linear Gaussian case, the relations de-
scribing the conditional mean and covariance ofp(xfc|zk) are the well-known
Kalman filter equations [2]. The difficulties associated with the explicit
determination of the a posteriori density have led to the development of approx-
imate procedures for estimating the state of nonlinear stochastic systems. The
most commonly used approximation involves the assumptions that the a priori
distributions are Gaussian and that the nonlinear system can be linearized rela-
tive to latest estimate yielding the "extended" Kalman filter which has seen
widespread application to nonlinear systems [2, 5,7].

The extended Kalman filter has performed well in many applications but
there are numerous examples in which unsatisfactory results have been obtained.
This has spurred the development of other procedures. Most of these either im-
plicitly or explicitly, retain the assumption that^xJz^ is Gaussian and essen-
tially provide a means for modifying the mean and covariance of the density.
However, the Gaussian assumption greatly reduces the generality or richness of
possible a posteriori densities throwing out all possibility of more realistic multi-
modal densities.

For this reason, the Gaussian sum method discussed below was developed
allowing the approximation of general a posteriori densities for nonlinear non-
Gaussian systems.

3. GAUSSIAN SUM APPROXIMATION TO A PRIORI DENSITIES

Since it is not generally possible to solve Eqs. (3-5), the Gaussian sum approx-
imation is introduced to allow at least approximate solution of these equations.
To maintain the advantages of the Gaussian densities, it is proposed that certain
a priori densities p( ) be represented or approximated by a linear combination of
Gaussian densities.

These two properties insure that the approximation is always positive and
integrates to a value of one. This approximation is thus a true probability
density function in its own right, and, when this representation is used in linear
problem, the Bayesian recursion relations can be solved exactly in closed form.

There are two questions that must be answered for this approximation to be
useful. The first is whether or not there exist approximations of the form for
given a priori densities, and secondly, can we obtain such approximations in a
reasonable manner.

The first question can be answered in the affirmative. In fact, ifg( ) is an
integrable function on a bounded or unbounded interval J, then given an
e &gt; 0, one can find a function p^ ( ) of the form of Eq. (6) such that:

 \gW-PAW\dx&lt;e.
JR"

This can be proven by appealing to Wiener's theorem on approximation [8], by
direct proof [9] or be considering delta functions of the positive type [10].
Thus this class of density functions is rich enough to approximate all density
functions of engineering interest arbitrarily well.

The second problem of obtaining specific approximations to a given a priori
density has been solved in two ways. First, one may reduce the problem to a
deterministic optimization problem and perform a numerical search for the
parameters of the Gaussian sum [9, 10]. The results of such approximation are
shown in Figs. 1 and 2. A fair amount of computer time is required to solve for
each approximate density. A second method based on the concept of delta
functions of positive type has proven more useful in practice. It has been found
that very adequate approximations can be obtained with no numerical search
simply by first spacing the Gaussian means uniformly over the region of state
space of interest, and secondly by choosing the variance to give a smooth fit. In
this approach, the weighting factors, a are chosen proportional to the magni-
tude of the value of the function to be approximated at the appropriate points.
Examples of Gaussian sum approximation to several densities which were ob-
tained by this method are shown in Figs. 3-5. Other examples are contained
in the references.

4. LINEAR SYSTEMS WITH GAUSSIAN NOISE BUT NON-GAUSSIAN
INITIAL STATE

When the system and measurement equations are linear and all the a priori
densities are Gaussian, all the a posteriori densities are also Gaussian with the
mean and covariance given by the Kalman filter. Thus the densities are re-
producing [11] in the sense that each density has the same form. When all of

GAUSSIAN SUM APPROXIMATIONS IN NONLINEAR FILTERING             283

the above assumptions hold except that the initial density p(xo) is a Gaussian
sum instead of Gaussian, the a posteriori densities are still truly reproducing,
since all the a posteriori densities are also Gaussian sums with the same number
of terms as the initial density. This use of Gaussian sums for nonlinear filtering
was mentioned by Aoki as early as 1965 [12] and has been considered by
Cameron [13], Lainiotis [15, 18], and Lo [17], as well as Alspach and
Sorenson [9, 10]. This case is particularly interesting since after the initial
approximation of the density p(xo) by a Gaussian sum density, one obtains the
exact solution of the Bayesian recursion relations. All of the terms of the sum
propagate forward in time by a set of independent Kalman filter equations,
while all nonlinear dependence on the measurement data is contained in the
weighting coefficients. These are not modified in propagations through the
prediction step of Eq. 4 and given that

^z^^f a;W(Xfc - Xfc,, p;,)

one can easily show that

N

where each x^. and p^. are related to x^. and p'ic by the usual Kalman filter
equations [2] and a, is given by

nfe,=7?t+//?,p^,//fc.

One should note that obtaining a best fit to a given a priori density p(xo) can be
performed off-line before the actual filtering begins.

This particular case can be useful in its own right when one has precise knowl-
edge of the statistic of the initial state or when one can transform a more com-
plicated case to this form, but it is more useful as an example of "exact" non-
linear filtering and as an indication of how to attack more general problems.

5. LINEAR SYSTEMS WITH NON-GAUSSIAN NOISE AND INITIAL STATE

If the linear measurements [2] are contaminated by non-Gaussian noise or
the linear system [1] is driven by non-Gaussian noise, one must extend the
method discussed in the last section. If one simply replaces the non-Gaussian

284                                                 D. L. ALSPACH

plant and measurement noise densities by Gaussian densities of the same mean
and covariance, a great deal of information may be lost and nonmeaningful
estimates obtained. However, if good Gaussian sum approximations of p(ujc)
and p(Wfc) are found, one may still solve the Bayesian recursion relations
(3)-(5) analytically [9, 10]. The resulting recursion relations are similar to
those discussed in Sec. 4 involving a number of Kalman filters evolving in
parallel with the nonlinear dependence on the measurements contained in the
weighting coefficients. The a posteriori densities resulting can be made as
accurate as desired by choice of the initial approximations [9].

The recursion relations are still reproducing in the sense that all the a
posteriori densities are still of the Gaussian sum form. However, to be truly
reproducing the number of terms in the sum at each stage should remain con-
stant. This is only the case when only the initial density is non-Gaussian. When
either the plant or measurement noise density is a Gaussian sum with more than
one term, the number of terms in the exactly calculated a posteriori densities
grows from stage to stage. It has been shown [10] that there are two factors
which can lead to the restriction of this growth by the use of natural approxi-
mations. The first arising from the form of the weighting coefficients of each
term allows one to drop negligible terms. These are terms in which the weight-
ing coefficient has become exponentially small.

The second approximation used results from the tendency of many terms to
converge to the same point and the fact that two identical terms can be com-
bined by adding their weighting coefficients. When the terms are only approxi-
mately the same, a bound on the Z,1 error introduced by both approximations
has been found.

The proofs of both theorems are straightforward and follow directly from
properties of multidimensional Gaussian distributions.

Lastly, experimental evidence shows that specific choices of number of terms
in the a priori densities and specific thresholds for the two approximations lead
to a bound on the number of terms required to describe the a posteriori den-
sities for any stage.

6. NONLINEAR SYSTEM

The most frequently used approach for the estimation of the state of a non-
linear system involves the linearization of the system relative to a best estimated
value for the state and the subsequent application of the Kalman filter equa-
tions. This approach results in approximations of two types. First, the non-
linear physical system is replaced by a linear model, and, second, the non-
Gaussian a posteriori density function p(xfe I z1') is approximated by a Gaussian
density. One other method that may be used on a small class of problems is
to transform the nonlinear problem to a linear problem. When this can be done
such that both the measurements and system are linear, one usually finds that
the Gaussian noise has been transformed to non-Gaussian noise. Under these
special conditions the method of Sec. 5 can be applied.

In Ref. [16], a filtering procedure is defined which is based on the utiliza-
tion of the Gaussian sum representation of the a posteriori density function in
conjunction with the linearization procedure that has proven so effective in

286                                                    D.L. ALSPACH

Kalman filter applications. This algorithm greatly extends the range of validity
of the linearization approximation of the nonlinear system and measurement
and eliminates the assumption that p (x^ I z^ is Gaussian. A general outline of
the simplest form of this algorithm follows. Suppose that a stage k, the one
stage predicted density p (xic I z'^'1 ), has been calculated and is of the form of
a Gaussian sum in Eq. (6). The filtering density p (xic I z^) is given from Eq. 3
by

N
p (Xfe I z^) = Cfc ^ 0!,-/V(xfe - a B,)p^ (zfc - hk (x^)).

i=l

As in the extended Kalman filter, linearize h^ relative to a, so that p, (z/c -
hfc (Xfc)) can be approximated by a Gaussian-like function in the region around
each a,. In the choice of Gaussian sum approximations to the a priori densities,
one makes the region which each term in the sum must cover "small," and then
the region in which this linearization must be valid is correspondingly small
(obviously much smaller than the region over which it would have to be valid
ifp(xk \zk~l) were represented by a single Gaussian). Once this is done, the a
posteriori density p (xic l z^ is in the form of a Gaussian sum, and the prediction
step of the Bayesian recursion relations Eq. (4) can be performed in the same
manner by linearizing p (Xfc+i I x^) about each term in the Gaussian sum for
p (xk I zk). Note that in this algorithm as in Sec. 4, the number of terms in the
Gaussian sum does not grow from stage to stage.

Under certain conditions, such as non-Gaussian plant or measurement noise,
it becomes necessary to approximate p (z/c I xic) and p Qcfc+i I x^) directly by
Gaussian sums. More details about these cases are given in Refs. [9] and [19] ;

a number of examples of both algorithms are given in the references. These
show the possible improvement of nonlinear filters over linearized Guassian
filters.

7. CONTROL THEORY

Often estimating the state of a system is only a stepping stone to allow the
control of that system. This would be the case when the system (1) contains
a control variable and one is to choose the control at each stage based on all
previous measurement data to minimize the expected value of a cost function
of the control and the state.

When the system is linear, it is well known that with a number of additional
assumptions the principle of optimality can be used to prove that the optimal
stochastic control problem can be solved by the solution of two independent
problems. First, an optimal estimate of the system state conditioned on all
available information is computed, and, secondly, a deterministic optimal con-

GAUSSIAN SUM APPROXIMATIONS IN NONLINEAR FILTERING             287

trol is calculated for the problem formed by replacing all a priori random vari-
ables by their mean values. Under the rather fortuitous circumstances when
the optimal control is composed of the optimal deterministic control with the
state at time k replaced by the best estimate of the state at time k the separation
theorem or separation principle is said to be valid. When this theorem does not
apply, the control resulting from this combination of an optimal estimate with
a deterministic control function is still often used and then the resulting control
called the certainty equivalence control [20, 21 ]. It is partially the separation
theorem and partially the extensive use of this suboptimal control that can ac-
count for the large interest by control engineers in the inherently secondary
problem of estimation theory. In Ref. [22], the proof of the separation
theorem is extended using the Gaussian sum method to linear systems with
quadratic cost but non-Gaussian initial state and non-Gaussian plant and
measurement noise.

In the more common situation where the separation theorem does not apply,
the more general dynamic programming approach has not been used partly be-
cause of the curse of dimensionality but mostly because it is not generally
possible to obtain the required a posteriori densities in the analytical form
required by the algorithm. However, by using the approximate densities dis-
cussed above preliminary investigation into the advantages to be gained from
use of optimal and suboptimal dual controllers has been made [23]. This
preliminary investigation indicates that there are potentially large benefits in
improved performance of stochastic systems from the use of controls different
from the certainty equivalence controls and which retain the dual nature of the
truly optimal control. The use of approximate a posteriori densities of one
form or another will be essential for this to be accomplished.

The Gaussian sum approach to deterministic control problems using the
duality between optimal control for deterministic systems and estimation for
stochastic systems has been investigated by Dajani and Campion [24], following
the similar approach [9, 10, 13-18] to the dual linear-Gaussian estimation
problem with non-Gaussian initial state-vector. The optimal control problem
for nonlinear systems with nonquadratic final-cost function was solved by
approximation of the Lyoponov function by a Gaussian sum.

8. DISCUSSION AND POTENTIAL FUTURE RESEARCH

There are several advantages and several limitations to the general approach
considered here. First, all of this work is based on the Bayesian approach which
must rest on the existence of the appropriate probability density functions.
This may pose a conceptual problem, but will hardly affect engineering prob-
lems of filtering and control. The nonlinear filters considered here require the

existence of at least a first derivative of the plant and measurement nonlin-
earities at the points of linearization. For a function that is nowhere differen-
tiable different techniques must be considered. The solution to the Bayesian
recursion relations can be implemented in a straightforward manner by the
methods considered here for both linear and nonlinear, Gaussian and non-
Gaussian problems to give approximate a posteriori density functions. These
density functions can be made arbitrarily close to the true densities, however
the computational requirements can easily become excessive as the number of
terms grows. An interesting alternative implementation of this filter is studied
in Ref. [25] which considers the use of parallel processing computers to exploit
the intrensic parallel nature of these filters. This is a natural choice, since all
the filters discussed here consist of a number of modulated Kalman or extended
Kalman filters operating in parallel.

One advantage of this class of filter over some others that have been ad-
vanced is the apparent ease with which symmetries in the state transition
function and measurement nonlinearities can be utilized to reduce the com-
putational complexity of a problem. A second advantage is the ease with which
moments can be obtained once the density approximation is found [10]. An
area of future work is the extension of the parallel processing work of Ref. [25].
The Gaussian sum filter should be implemented in detail on an existing parallel
processing computer such as the ILLIAC IV and simulation results obtained.

There are several other areas requiring more detailed research. First, and
most direct, is the application of these methods to a number of additional test
problems. Several additional nonlinearities should be investigated as well as
problems of higher dimension. Results obtained from these studies should be
compared to other possible filters such as the linearized filters [3], the Senne-
Bucy digital filters [26], and Spline filters [27]. The classes of problems which
require or can justify nonlinear filtering should then be outlined and those
classes of problems best suited to each of the recently developed nonlinear
filtering methods should be mapped out. Possible combinations of the various
methods for optimal results should also be considered. An interesting paper by
Center on a generalized least-squares approach to the approximation of con-
ditional density functions has already pointed out many similarities and relation-
ships between the different approaches mentioned above [28]. These relation-
ships mentioned earlier by Lainiotis [29] should be a logical starting place for a
study of the relative usefulness of each method.

In addition to the above work, the basic filter algorithms should be extended
to include such additional factors as nonadditive noise, state and control de-
pendent noise, unknown plant and measurement covariance matrices, and un-
known initial error covariance matrix. Lastly, but perhaps most important, is
the continued development and study of stochastic controls which retain the
dual nature of the optimal control and can be implemented in a realistic manner.

GAUSS1AN SUM APPROXIMATIONS IN NONLINEAR FILTERING             289

By using these general methods to obtain stochastic controllers and approxi-
mations to optimal nonlinear filters, we will obtain a greater understanding of
the nature of the problems, the nature of the truly optimal filter, and the dual
nature of the optimal stochastic control. With this greater understanding, it
may well be possible to implement an adequate filter or a greatly improved
control in a much simpler manner than by the direct use of the methods dis-
cussed here or in the references.

					<ce:simple-para view="all">This paper presents a survey of some recent results in the fields of nonlinear filtering and stochastic control resulting from the use of Gaussian sum approximations to certain density functions. When trying to estimate and control the state of a nonlinear stochastic dynamic system from noisy measurement data, the 
						<ce:italic>a posteriori</ce:italic> density of the state conditioned on the measurement data contains all of the available information about the system state. If these densities were available, it should be possible to develop “optimal” estimation and control policies. The well-known Bayesian recursion relations describe the evolution of this 
						<ce:italic>a posteriori</ce:italic> density in terms of given 
						<ce:italic>a priori</ce:italic> densities, the system dynamics and measurement equations and the available data. Unfortunately, it is seldom possible to solve these closed forms for the required 
						<ce:italic>a posteriori</ce:italic> densities. Over the last few years it has been shown that when the 
						<ce:italic>a priori</ce:italic> densities are approximated by a sum of Gaussian densities with positive weighting coefficients that linear non-Gaussian problems can be solved analytically and that new natural solutions to nonlinear problems are available. Recently this method has been extended to dual deterministic optimal control problems.
