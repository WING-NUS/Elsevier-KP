The Implicit Conditioning Method in Statistical Mechanics

JOHN M. RICHARDSON
Electronics Research Division, Rockwell International, Anaheim, California

ABSTRACT

It is well known that least mean square estimation can be employed to calculate condi-
tional means, a procedure called the implicit conditioning method in this paper. It is possi-
ble to construct a priori probability densities of tractable form that, when conditioned on
certain sets of variables, reduce to conditional probability densities which are identical to
the canonical probability densities occurring in the statistical mechanics of certain classical
systems. This yields a new variational principle for the calculation of canonical mean values
in classical statistical mechanics. In this paper, two versions of this variational principle are
applied to a simple lattice system to yield approximate expressions for the canonical mean
values of certain properties of physical interest.

1. INTRODUCTION

It is well known that least mean square estimation can be employed as a
method for obtaining conditional mean values. This is, of course, due to the
fact that the optimal estimator is the mean value of the function to be estimated,
conditioned by the observed variables. Obviously, this approach can be used for
obtaining approximate conditional mean values simply by using candidate esti-
mators of restricted functional form. In this paper, the above procedure is called
the implicit conditioning method.

Lainiotis [1] and the author [2] have independently applied the above im-
plicit conditioning method in information sciences to several problems that do
not involve mean square optimization criteria ab initio. The author [3] has also
applied this method to the approximate calculation of mean values in the classi-
cal statistical mechanics of interacting particles, a problem area apparently re-
mote from estimation theory. The present paper is concerned with the applica-
tion of two versions of the implicit conditioning method to a simple classical
lattice system.

2. THE GENERAL METHOD

Let us consider an «-dimensional state vector x, x  R", and an w-dimen-
sional vector function u (x) with m &lt; n. We observe that in statistical mechanics

some probability densities of a relatively complex structure can be expressed in
the form of conditional probability densities P(x\u) associated with uncondi-
tional (i.e., a priori) probability densities?^) of a relatively simple structure.

In statistical mechanics, a frequent objective is the determination of the mean
values of certain prescribed functions ofx and, if the objectives are not of this
kind (e.g., determination of free energy), they can be related to mean values of
the above type. Thus, we can restrict our attention to the calculation of mean
values, which in the context of the present formalism means the calculation of
conditional mean values using P(x \u).

Let us first consider the function a(x). The appropriate mean value is then
the conditional mean£'(a|u). There are at least two ways for calculating this
quantity. One is the obvious direct procedure of calculating

E(a\u)= fdxa(x)P(x\u),                   (1)
where

dx=f[dx,                           (2)

is the volume element nuc-space and where the integration spans all of this
space. The second way involves the use of the well-known minimal variance
estimation procedure which we now describe. Let us now imagine in the con-
text of estimation theory that we know the value of u (x) and wish to make an
estimate a(u(x)) of the value ofa(;c). Using a mean square criterion, the opti-
mal estimator a(u) is obtained by determining which of its possible functional
forms minimizes

E(a(u(x))-a(x))2.                       (3)

It is to be stressed that in the last expression we have used the unconditional
(a priori) mean. It is well known that the exact solution to this problem is

&amp;(u)=E(a\u),                         (4)

namely the conditional mean of a.

We will call the direct procedure for calculating E(a\u) the explicit condi-
tioning method and the least mean square procedure the implicit conditioning
method, although the two methods are completely equivalent if carried out
exactly. It is in the case of approximation techniques that the two methods are
strikingly different. The explicit method does not readily suggest approximation
techniques beyond those already developed in the field of statistical mechanics.
The implicit method on the other hand opens up a wide set of possible new ap-
proximation techniques because of its variational structure.

IMPLICIT CONDITIONING METHOD IN STATISTICAL MECHANICS           239

In the two following sections, we will illustrate the application of two differ-
ent implicit conditioning methods to calculation of approximate calculation of
mean values in the equilibrium statistical mechanics of a simple one-dimensional
lattice system.

3. APPLICATION OF THE FIRST IMPLICIT CONDITIONING
METHOD TO A LATTICE SYSTEM

In the present and following sections, we consider two distinctly different
implicit conditioning methods applied to a simple one-dimensional lattice sys-
tem [4]. We assume the energy of such a system to be given by

e = -, Z SrsXrXs + Z ^x                    (5)

~ rs               r

where the x^ are here assumed to take the values ±1. The energy matrix e^ is
assumed to depend only on I (r - s) mod N \, i.e., cyclic boundary conditions are
imposed. The indices r and s take the values 1, 2,..., N. In this treatment we
assume that N is even. Since x^ = 1, the diagonal terms in which r = s, i.e.,
errXrXr, are independent ofx,. and also r. Thus, they are ignorable constants
giving a physically meaningless shift of the zero of energy. In the usual treat-
ments of systems of this kind the diagonal terms are omitted. However, here we
will retain the diagonal terms, thereby retaining their common value as a free
parameter that will be useful in the context of approximation methods. It is to
be noted that ^ 2e^^x with the omission of diagonal terms, represents the
interaction energy among the lattice elements each of which has the possible
states Xr = ± 1. The other term S,.T?,.X,. represents the interaction between the
elements and an internal force.

The so-called canonical probability [5] is an exponential function of the
energy, that is the probability of {x^} = (xi,..., x^) is given by

^({^})=Z-'exp(-ße)                   (6)

where e is given by (5) and where ß = l/xr, in which T is the absolute tempera-
ture and K, is the Boltzmann constant. The normalization factor Z = Z(ß) is the
well-known partition function of statistical mechanics. The canonical mean
value of a function a({xr}) is clearly

E,a=Z-1   Z a({^})exp(-ße).            (7)

{^-i}

It is the purpose of the remainder of this section and also the next section to
compute canonical mean values of various functions by two different implicit
conditioning methods.

240                                           JOHN M. RICHARDSON

In the first implicit conditioning method we consider an unconditional proba-
bility function [6] containing the discrete valued variables {x^} and the con-
tinuous valued Gaussian random variables {vy} = (vi,..., i^y). The Xy are as-
sumed to be statistically independent and each Xy is assumed to take the values
±1 with equal probability. The Gaussian random variables i&gt;r are defined by the
relations

Ev, = 0,

Z^^r'S^                         (8)
Thus the unconditional mean of any function f({xr}, {vr}) is given by
Ef({x,}, {v,})

=2-^  Z   fnf^^Tr^expf-^^)
{^±i}J r\             \2   II

/(W {^}).                                 (9)

Now let us assume that this probability function is to be conditioned on the
set of variables {u,} = (ui,.. . u^} where

"r = Z Ors^s + "r,                         (10)

r   ^ "rs-^s ' "r
s

Henceforth, the «,. will be called conditioning variables. The conditional mean
of a function a({x^}) is then given by [7]

E(a\[ur=Ur})

V"              / 1                        \

are imposed. In order that the energy matrix e be represented in the form
(12), it must be nonnegative definite, a condition that can always be achieved
by choosing the common value of the diagonal elements e,.r sufficiently large
and positive.

According to Sec. 2, the implicit conditioning method involves the con-
sideration of the candidate estimator a ({y,.}) and the optimization of the func-
tional form of this estimator according to the mean square criterion E(â([Ur}) -
a({x,.}))2. Without limitations on its form the optimal estimator a({u,.}) is,
after letting u^ = M,., precisely equal to the conditional mean of a ({;(:,.}) which
according to ( 11 ) is also the canonical mean of a ( {x,.}). If a restricted set of
candidate trial estimators are used then the best estimator is suboptimal and
hence an approximation to the canonical mean.

Let us consider the estimation ofx^ as a special case. The estimator is of
course x^( { u^}) and the optimal form of it is given by the maximization of
E(xr({u,}) - Xr)2. Then the optimal form, with the iiy substituted by their
numerical values Uy, is equal to canonical mean of ;&lt;,., i.e.,

^r,opt({Us})=EcXr,                      (14)
we can compute some other means of interest by using the relation,

.-^-E,x,=E^cX,\x                 (15)

where A(,(') = () - £'c(')- This result can be readily derived from (5) and (7).
From E^Xr and E^x^x^ we can compute the canonical mean of the energy (5)
and then ultimately deduce other thermodynamic functions of interest.

As an example of a suboptimal estimator let us consider a candidate estimator
that is composed of a constant and terms linear in the iiy, namely

^({uJ)=a,+L b^u,.                (16)
i

Substitution of this expression in the mean square criterion and subsequent
minimization on the coefficients a,, and e yields the moment equations

a,=Ex^O,                       (17)

^ b,sEUsllt=EXrUt.                       (18)

s

In deriving these results we have used the fact that EXy = 0 and Ev^ = 0 where-
upon Eu r = 0. A straightforward calculation yields

Eu.u^e^+ß-^^                   (19)

EXrUs = a^r,                             (20)

which completes the description of the moment equations.

242                                           JOHN M. RICHARDSON

The solution of the moment equation (14) is easily obtained by going over to
a representation in which e and o are diagonalized. We have assumed that e
depends only on I (r - s) mod N \ and thus we can assume without inconsistency
that drs has the same property. The wavelike basis vectors N'111 exp (ikr),
k = 2ml N, n=0,l,...,N- I, then provides the appropriate representation.
We then define [8]

îîî=i?2k-fc,                       (23a)

when ^ ^ 0. When k = O, the above quantities are real. From the above ex-
pressions we deduce that these quantities are also real when k = TT. Since e^s and
Ors are symmetric (which is a consequence of the assumption that they depend
only on | (p - s) mod N 1), it follows that 6^ and aiç are real. Nonnegative
definiteness implies that e^ is nonnegative. It will be 'inferred later that b^ is
positive.

The candidate estimator (16) now takes the form

^fc({"fc'})=flfc+efc"fc.                  06a)
The first moment equation (17) obviously reduces to

flfc = 0,                          (17a)
and the second moment equation becomes

bk(ek+ß~l)=^,                    (18a)

which is an approximation to the canonical average ofx^. Since, in the present
representation, (13) is rewritten in the form

T1k=-OkUk,                           (13a)

(28) can be rewritten exclusively in terms of quantities of physical significance,
i.e.,

Using (11) translated into the present representation, we deduce m the force-free
case (r]k = 0) that

where E^ denotes that the canonical mean is calculated with the 17^ = 0. In de-
riving (30) we have used the fact that E^x^ = 0. In the original representation

E^x, ^ N-1 S  exp Cikfy - s)).            (31)

r PCfc + 1

This expression gives an approximation to the correlation between the states of
different lattice elements in the absence of external forces.

We turn now to a brief discussion of the nature of the above approximation.
When r ^ s it can be shown that the exact left-hand side and the approximate
right-hand side of (31) agree to order ß. More specifically,

E^x,x, = 5,, - (5e + 0 032 ),                    (32)

N-1 E , ^P o'^ -s)) =§" - ^+ 0 o32).       (33)

k   ß^ ' 1

where it is understood that the symbol 0 (ß2 ) occurring in (32) and (33) do not
necessarily represent the same numerical quantities. Thus the present approxi-

244                                           JOHN M. RICHARDSON

mation is exact in the high temperature (small ß) limit. In a rough qualitative
way the approximation is good ifßefc is not large compared with unity for most
of the values of k.

However, when r = s the right- and left-hand sides of (31 ) are equal only to
order unity in the context of a ß expansion. Equality to order ß is achieved by
setting e,.r = 0, which then violates the condition that the matrix e be non-
negative definite (or, equivalently, that the e^ be nonnegative for all k). Without
expanding in ß the exact left-hand side of (31) is given by

E^=\,                            (34)

which is trivial since x^ = 1. With r = s the approximate right-hand side of (31)
reduces to

^c^"'              w)

since there are in the sum N terms of the form USe^+i)"1 which are not greater
than unity and some of which must be less than unity. Equality of (34) and
(35) is obtained only if all of the e^ vanish or, equivalently, all elements of the
matrix e,., vanish. This is a vacuous case.

As an ad hoc procedure, one could ignore the approximation to E^x^ and use
instead the trivially calculated exact value, namely unity. In order to minimize
the difference of the approximate and exact values, i.e., the difference between
(34) and (35), one could choose a value ofe,.,. (which is independent ofr) that is
as small as possible under the constraint of nonnegative definiteness of e. The
possibility of analytic continuation of e^r below this value requires further
investigation.

It is of physical interest to calculate an approximation to the canonical mean
interaction energy in the force-free case. The interaction energy e' can be
written

e'=,l^'e^x                   (36)

rs

where the prime on the summation denotes the omission of terms for which
r = s. This expression differs from that for e, given by (5), by the omission of
the "self-energy" terms e^x^ which are not physically meaningful. Clearly, the
force-free canonical mean of e' is

E^'^-^Z'e^x^.                 (37)

rs

Substituting the approximation (31), we obtain

With source rearrangements, this result can be rewritten in the alternative form

c      4S^^l-ße^l)(efc-ek)           &lt;39)

which is obviously negative.

An alternative way to obtain an approximation to E^x^x, or equivalently
E^ \x^\1 is to find a best estimator for p^ ê \x^\2. Let us consider a candidate
estimator of the form [9]

Pk=cs+bu,+^ck'(\u\2 ~E\u^~),            (40)
k'

U0 =uk\k=0'

where we have included only those terms of the second degree or less that are
invariant to translation (equivalently, invariant to phase changes of the u^).
Terms not invariant to translation could be included but they would be orthogo-
nal (e.g., fUjJUfel2 = O, k ^ 0) to the invariant terms thus not affecting the
optimization of (40) and furthermore such terms will vanish in the force-free
limit. Since, by the reality condition (22), | u J2 = \u^-ic\2, linear independence
of the terms |uJ2 - E\u^\2 can be achieved only if 0 &lt; k &lt; TT, the half-domain.
Thus the sum on k' in (36) must be limited to this half-domain.

Minimization of the mean square criterion with respect to the coefficients in
(39) yields finally

Pfc,min("fc=0)=+0(YV-1),
pek + 1

.^°1^12.                                (41)

This approximation agrees with (30) except for terms of the order N~1 and thus
the two methods for calculating^ \x^\2 discussed in this section are asymptoti-
cally equivalent.

4. APPLICATION OF THE SECOND IMPLICIT CONDITIONING METHOD

Now we treat the one-dimensional lattice system described in the last section
by an entirely different implicit conditioning method. In this treatment we will
consider only the force-free case (i.e., the r)s = 0).

246                                           JOHN M. RICHARDSON

In the present method, we will use an unconditional probability density in
which the variables x, are continuous variables, each with a domain (-°°, °°).
Specifically, we will assume that the x, are Gaussian random variables with

Ex,=0, (42)

and

Ex^x^ß^e^,                   (43)

where e^1 is the matrix inverse of e. Here it is obvious that the common value
of the physically meaningless diagonal elements Crr must be chosen to be suffi-
ciently large and positive to insure the positive definiteness of e (not merely
nonnegative definiteness as was required in the last section). However, later we
will, in some cases, allow asymptotic nonnegative definiteness as N -&gt; °°. The un-
conditional probability density is clearly given by the expression

p(x,) = [det (ßeJ2n)1'2 exp I- - ß Z e^x,}],         (44)

L                  \     rs       /J

assuming a volume measure II,. Ax,..

Here we will assume the conditioning variables

u,=x^,r=l,...,N.                  (45)

It is obvious that the conditional mean ofa({x^}) with the u,. = 1 is identical to
the force-free canonical average of a discussed in the last section, that is

E(a | u, = 1 ) = f n (dx, 8 (u, - l )) a(x,) exp f-1 ß S ^ x^}

J                                  \      rs          l

u E^ a.                                        (46)

In the subsequent treatment we will consider a more general class of problems
involving all positive values of the Ur. Equation (46) is an example of the
0-function method of Montroll [10].

As discussed before £'(a [{»,.}) can be obtained by finding the functional form
of the estimator »({«,.}) that minimizes the mean square criterion E (a - a)2.

where the subscript k - k' is to be interpreted as (k - k') mod 1v. The reader is
reminded that the reality conditions are

xk =x2^!-k

uî-^-k                              (50)

except when k = O in which case the quantities x^ and u^ are real. It is easily
seen that x^ and Uiç are also real when k = n:

A reasonable candidate estimator for p^ is

Other terms linear initie, k 1=0, are excluded by translational invariance. Inser-
tion of this candidate estimator into the mean square criterion and minimization
on the coefficients a^ and bk yields the moment equations

where, as in the last section,

A(.) =()-£().                      (54)

We obtain

It follows that the best candidate estimator is

Pfc.min ({"fc}) = OW + N1!17-1 efc2 Auo,           (58)
where, of course, Auo = "o - ^"o and where

To obtain an approximation to the force-free canonical mean we must assign the
conditioning variables values corresponding to the physical problem, i.e., setting
the Ur = 1. This is equivalent to letting u^ = N^2 when k = 0 and u^ = 0 when
k + 0. We now obtain

Pfc,min("fc =Nli2ô)=^(ße,r t^-1 e-^N1!2 - N-1!2 ^ (iSe^-1},

In the last section, we noted that in the first implicit conditioning method
that the approximation to E^p^ considered there could not be made consistent
with the identity

no matter what we chose for the common value of the diagonal elements e^ of
the energy matrix under the restriction of non-negative definiteness. In the
present method, it is possible to make the approximation consistent with (61)
by requiring e,.r (independent ofr) to be chosen so that

ZPfc.mina^A^W)^.                  (62)

It can be shown that this condition is satisfied if in (61) the force-free canonical
meatiE^pic is replaced by unconditional mean.E'p giving

and

The last result is clearly consistent with (61).

IMPLICIT CONDITIONING METHOD IN STATISTICAL MECHANICS          249

Let us examine in more detail the relation (63) and the possibility of its be-
ing satisfied by any common value of Crr admissible under the condition of
positive definiteness of e. By making e^ sufficiently large and positive we can
make the sum S^e^1 as close to zero (on the positive side) as we please. On the
other hand, by making e^ sufficiently small (within the condition of positive
definiteness) the smallest of the e^ can be made arbitrarily close to zero (on the
positive side since positive definiteness implies that all of the eic are positive)
and thus the sum S^e^1 can be made arbitrarily large and positive. Since there
are no gaps between the extreme values discussed above, it follows that the rela-
tion (63) can always be satisfied. It should be noted the common value of the
e,.r chosen in this way, will depend on ß.

The force-free canonical mean of the interaction energy e', given by (36), can
be written for the present approximation in the equivalent forms

r-,0 f ^ i K T n-ï V^ I   i      n    \       l V /-         t \/   l         l   \

The last expression is obviously negative.

5. SUMMARY AND COMMENTS

In Sec. 2, it is shown in a general way how implicit conditioning can be ap-
plied to the calculation of mean values in classical statistical mechanics. In
Sees. 3 and 4, we consider the application of two versions of the implicit condi-
tioning method to a simple classical lattice system in which the state of the rth
lattice site is Xy which takes the value ±1.

In the first version discussed in Sec. 3, we assume that the a priori mean is
defined by (9) and that the conditioning variables Uy are defined by (10). In
(11), we show that the conditional average of a function a is identical to its
canonical mean. It is to be noted that the conditioning variables enter the
canonical mean as parameters in the potentials of external force in accordance
with (13). The variational principle for the calculation of the canonical mean
value of a is the minimization of the mean square criterion E (a ({u,.}) -
"({^r}))2 on ^e functional form of the estimator a({»J). If the optimal form
of the estimator $({«).}) is obtained, it is then exactly equal to the canonical
mean of a.

We illustrate the use of this version of the method to obtain approximately
the canonical mean value ofx,. with an applied external force by considering a
candidate estimator Xr({Ur}) of restricted form, i.e., one composed of a constant
term and a term linear in the u^. The result is given in (28). The force-free
canonical average oîXfXs is obtained by differentiating the canonical mean ofx,.
with respect to the external force applied at the lattice site s followed by setting

250                                           JOHN M. RICHARDSON

all of the external forces equal to zero. The result of this operation is given in
(30) or, equivalently, in (31).

In Sec. 3, we also show how an approximation to the force-free canonical
mean ofx^x, can be obtained by considering a candidate estimator for XyXy
which is composed of a constant term and another term composed of a transia-
tionally invariant (in the cyclic boundary condition sense) quadratic form in the
conditioning variables y,.. The result obtained by this approach, after setting the
Ur equal to zero, is asymptotically (i.e., in the limit of an infinite lattice) identi-
cal to previous approximate method for calculating the force-free canonical
mean ofx^Xy.

In Sec. 4, we consider a quite different implicit conditioning method applied
to the same lattice system. Here the a priori probability density is defined by
(44) with the variables x,. now regarded as continuous variables, each in the in-
terval (-°°,00). The conditioning variables u,, defined by (45), after the assign-
ment of appropriate numerical values, serve to limit the variables x,. to the values
±1 in the conditional average. As before, we demonstrate that the conditional
and canonical averages are identical if, again, the conditioning variables are as-
signed appropriate numerical values. As in Sec. 3, the variational principle for
the calculation of canonical mean of a is the minimization of the mean square
criterion on the functional form of the estimator. However, now the a priori
mean and the conditioning variables are defined differently.

As in Sec. 3, we carry out an approximate calculation of the force free ca-
nonical mean ofx^Xs by using a candidate estimator composed of a constant
term and a translationally invariant linear combination of the conditioning
variables u,. The result is presented in (60).

A few additional remarks are in order concerning the comparison of the ap-
proximation calculations of the force-free canonical mean ofXyX^ using the two
implicit conditioning methods described in Sec. 3 and Sec. 4, respectively. In
the lattice energy ^'S^e^XrXs, the diagonal terms e^XyXr = ex^ = e are
clearly physically meaningless, since they collectively represent an addition of a
constant to the energy. Thus, these diagonal terms (which have the same value
independent ofr) constitute a free parameter that can be adjusted to improve
approximations. However, this parameter is subject to a lower bound arising
from the fact that the energy matrix e is required to be at least nonnegative
definite in each of the two implicit conditioning methods. Since when r = s the
value ofx^Xs = x^ = 1 is clearly known for the lattice system, one is entitled to
require that the approximate force-free canonical mean ofx^Xy be consistent
with this. Of course, if one could carry out either of the two implicit condi-
tioning methods exactly, one would obtain this consistency regardless of the
value chosen for e^r within the lower bound restriction. In the approximate
form of the first implicit conditioning method, it is impossible to achieve con-
sistency with any allowable value of e^r, except in the limit ß -&gt; 0. But, in the

IMPLICIT CONDITIONING METHOD IN STATISTICAL MECHANICS          251

approximate form of the second implicit conditioning method, it is indeed pos-
sible to obtain consistency by choosing an allowable value of e^. When this is
done, the approximation is equivalent to the spherical approximation (or model,
depending upon one's viewpoint) of Kac and Berlin (11). It is worthy of note
that, if ,.,. can be analytically continued below its lower bound in the approxi-
mate form of the first implicit conditioning method, then consistency can be
achieved and furthermore both implicit conditioning methods give identical re-
sults at the present level of approximation. The validity of this analytical
continuation warrants further investigation.

Above, we have discussed the results obtained from two exact variational
principles using very simple candidate estimators of restricted form. The ques-
tion naturally arises: How does one construct candidate estimators yielding
better approximations? As in all variational techniques, adding more adjustable
parameters in the candidate estimator ultimately yields a result at least as good
as the previous one. One example of such an approach is to extend the power
series in the conditioning variables Uy, used in Sees. 3 and 4, to higher powers
with more adjustable coefficients. There are clearly a large number of other
possibilities to consider. It is reasonable to ask if the implicit conditioning
method can be applied to other classical systems. As far as the author knows,
there is no problem in classical statistical mechanics to which this method cannot
be applied. Whether the application is fruitful or not depends upon the particu-
lar system considered, how the a priori statistics and conditioning variables are
chosen, and finally how adroit the investigator is in constructing a set of candi-
date estimators. An important point to emphasize is that rather obvious candi-
date estimators of simple form frequently lead to nontrivial, as is illustrated in
the present paper and in an earlier paper by this author [3].

It is also possible to apply the implicit conditioning method to the computa-
tion of mean values in quantum statistical mechanics. It is possible to apply this
method to the Feynman [12, 13] path integral (i.e., functional integration)
formulation of quantum statistical mechanics without going beyond the well
established domain of estimation theory. It is, however, possible to apply the
method to quantum statistical mechanics expressed in more conventional quan-
tum mechanical languages by extending estimation theory to the quantum
domain.
