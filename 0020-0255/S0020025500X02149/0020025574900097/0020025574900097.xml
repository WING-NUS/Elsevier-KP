ABSTRACT

The modeling of a random process as the output of a linear, causal, and causally inveit-
ibie filter has been considered by a number of authors. Various approaches that have been
used are summarized here. The spectral multiplicity of the random process plays a funda-
mental role in this problem and permits a general and unified approach. In this framework,
necessary or sufficient conditions for unit multiplicity are obtained on the system's impulse
response function and on the output process itself. The role of spectral multiplicity in
linear least-mean-square estimation is also clarified.

I. INTRODUCTION AND PRELIMINARY REMARKS

It is often important to model a random process x(t) in a simple and mathe-
matically tractable way. A popular model which possesses these two properties
and in addition provides some physical insight into the generation and sto-
chastic structure of the process is the one where the process x (f) is considered
to be the output of a causal, linear, time-varying system h(t, r) with a white
noise input n (t).

This model is often encountered in problems of detection, estimation, and
optimization. Of particular interest in most of these problems is the possibility
of "inversion" or "equivalence"; that is, the possibility of obtaining the white
noise n (t) by passing the output x (t) through another causal linear system.

It is not known precisely which processes admit this model. Over the last
two decades considerable attention has been paid to this question, and it turns
out that there are substantial classes of processes which can be modeled in this
manner. However, there is a tendency to assume this structure for any random
process, and it is important to know when the assumption is justified. A uni-
fied and general approach is provided by the notion of spectral multiplicity of
a random process, as introduced by Cramer [1,2] and Hida [3]. In this frame-

work, it is possible to obtain a complete answer by specifying necessary and
sufficient conditions on either the impulse response function h{t, r) of the sys-
tem or on the random process x (t) itself; that is,

(1) If a linear, causal system is described by its impulse response function
h(t, r) and a given white noise is applied at the input, under what con-
ditions on h(t, r) is it possible to "invert" the output and obtain the
given white noise by linear filtering?

(2) If a random process x (t) is given, under what conditions is it possible to
represent it as the output of a causal, linear system with a white noise
input and when is this representation invertible?
The output JC (/) of the system with impulse response function h (t, r) and
white noise input n {t) can be written formally as the convolution

-£

^(0=   h(t,T)n(r)dT.                     (1)

--00

To avoid difficulties involved in interpreting this integral, consider n(f) to be the
"derivative" of a process with orthogonal increments z(t). Now Eq. (1) can be
written as

:

-r(0=J  h(,t,T)dz(f).                        (2)

"-- 00

The equality holds in the mean-square (m.s.) sense and the integral, converging
also in the m.s. sense, is interpreted as an ordinary stochastic integral [4, p.
426]. Note that, as pointed out in [4], this integral usually will not converge
sample-function-wise because z(/) is rarely of bounded variation. For example,
in the case of Brownian motion, almost all sample functions are not of bounded
variation m any finite interval. In the sequel, Eq. (2) will be employed.

Cramer [1,2] has shown that any second-order process x(t), under the weak
condition that the m.s. limits x(t ± 0) exist for all t G.R, admits the following
decomposition:

x(t)=u(t)+v(t),                        (3)

where u(t) is a. deterministic random process, v(t) is a purely non-deterministic
(pnd) random process and'

H(x,t)=H(u,t)&lt;BH(u,t)                    (4)

lff^x, t) denotes the closed linear manifold spanned by the random variables x (s)
for s s» t. Also H(x, -°°) = n fH(x, t). Then a deterministic process is one for which
H(x, -°°) = H(x, t), W e R. A purely non-deterministic process has the property
H(x, -°°) = 0.

Furthermore the pnd portion ofx(t) has the following decomposition which is
sometimes called canonical:

v(t)

1=1 "-&lt;»

(5)

where the z,(f) are mutually orthogonal processes with orthogonal increments.
The functions F;(T) defined by £'[û?z;(r)]2 = dF,(T) can be chosen to have
bounded variation. The functions gj(t, r) belong to /-z (dF^ ; -°°, °°), respec-
tively. Important additional properties of Eq. (5) are the following:

(i) The number N (which can be any finite integer or °°) is uniquely deter-
mined by the autocovariance function of x(t). The autocovariance
function also determines whether u (t) = 0. The number N is called the
spectral multiplicity of the process.
(ii) H(u,t)=H(z^t)S...S)H(z^,t),\/t'£R.                       (6)

Thus, in view of Eq. (2), it follows immediately that both aspects of the prob-
lem, as described in the introduction, are equivalent to determining under what
conditions JC (/) is a pnd process with multiplicity one. The invertibility of the
representation is then guaranteed by Eq. (6), which becomes, forJV= 1,

(6a)

Any random process x{t) of the class given by Eq. (3) can therefore be de-
rived from two sources of elementary processes as shown in Fig. 1. From Eqs.

u(t ) = deterministic




v(t)= pnd

(3) and (5), the first source is a deterministic component u(t) and the second
source is a set of uncorrelated "white noise" processes z, (f). The usefulness of
this representation lies primarily in the simplicity and realizability of the opera-
tions by which the process x (?) can be obtained from the original sources.

Only processes of second-order with right and left mean-square limits will be
considered. Evidently the impulse response functions will be required to match
suitable white noise inputs, so that

Rxx(t,t)= f  I^T)!2^;«-

«'-00

with dF(r) = E[dz(r)] 2. To avoid trivial complications, it is convenient to
consider processes with zero means and such that

x(t- 0)^x(t)sindx(t)^x(t+0)
do not hold simultaneously for any t e R.

II. CONDITIONS ON THE IMPULSE RESPONSE

The first problem is to determine conditions on the impulse response func-
tion of a given causal linear system so that a white noise input n (t) can be re-
obtained from the output x(t) by a causal, linear operation. In view ofCramer's
representation and since

x(t)=\ h{t,r)dz(r)                       (7)

 oo

it can only be concluded in general that2

H(x,t)CH(z,t)

and that x(t) must be pnd. What is desired are the conditions under which Eq.
(7) implies that

H(x,t)=H(z,t)

and hence that x (t) has unit multiplicity.

The expression for x(t) in Eq. (7) suggests, however, that even when H(x, t)
is a proper subspace offf(z, t), the process x(t) might still have unit multi-
plicity; that is, there might exist another process z'(/) with orthogonal incre-
ments and another impulse response function h'(t, r) such that

Provided that h (t, r) is a function and not a distribution. For example, if h(t, r) is a
(T-function such as ^S (t - r), thenH(x, t) 3 H(z, t) [10].

and in addition

x(t)=C h'(t,r)dz\T)

-00

H(x,t)=H(z',t),\/t«ER.

However, a process given by Eq. (7) need not have unit multiplicity as the fol-
lowing simple counterexample demonstrates. Let z(r) be an arbitrary process
with orthogonal increments such that E [dz(r)]2 = dr and let

h(t, r) = O, t &lt; ty and a &lt; T &lt; b &lt; to.

It is then clear that H(x, t) ^ ff(z, t) for t &gt; a since any element of the form
z(c) - z(d), with a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b, belongs to H(z, t), but is orthogonal to H(x, t).
The impulse response h(t, r) can be arbitrary for t &lt; /o and T ^ [a, b}. For
t &gt; to define h{t, r) to be zero for r ^ [a, b] and, for T £ [fl, A], to be

Furthermore, both Zi and z; are orthogonal to //(x-, to). Thus for any t&gt; to,
the space //(x, r) consists ofH(x, to) and the vectors z i and Zi. Consequently

Then, according to Cramer [1, 2], the point to is a point of increase ofH(x, ty)
with dimension equal to two and the multiplicity of.x(f) at this point cannot be
less than two. It is easy to see how this counterexample can be modified in
order for x(t) to have arbitrary multiplicity.

138                                    A. EPHREMIDES AND J. B. THOMAS

The crucial factor in determining the multiplicity oîx(t) ofEq. (7) is that
the intersection of the spaces H(x, t + o) for 5 &gt; O does not necessarily reduce
to the space H(x, t), but might contain the latter as a proper subspace. Define
Ho (x, t) as the orthogonal complement ofH(x, t) with respect to n 5 &gt; o H(x,
t + 5) so that

Ho (x, t)=\\ H(x, t + 6) QH(x, t).

6 &gt;0

The dimension of the space Ho (x, t) is related to the multiplicity of the process
x(t), as shown by Cramer [1,2]. In particular, if the process x(t) is given by
Eq. (7), it can be shown that its multiplicity is one iff the dimension oïHo(x, t)
is&lt;l.

It should be noted that a random process x(t) given by Eq. (7) is always pnd,
since H(x, t) C H(z, t) and H{z, -°°) = 0 since z{f) is a process with orthogonal
increments. The role of the space Ho (x, t) will be discussed again in a slightly
different context in the second part of this paper. The criterion represented by
the dimensionality of Ho (x, t), general though it is, is not clearly related to the
impulse response function h (t, r). In the remainder of this section, therefore,
the invertibility problem will be examined by specifying directly conditions on
h(t,T).

A number of authors [5, 6] have considered the invertibility of linear, time-
varying systems. However, in much of the work on the subject, attention has
been limited to systems described by a linear differential equation. Particular
interest has been expressed [7, 8, 9] in the finite-dimensional lumped linear
network described by

dx(t)=A(t)x_(t)dt-^B{t}dw(f).                (8)

Usually in this model restrictions on A{f) and 5(?) insure the invertibility of
the system. In such cases, the equivalence of input and output in the sense of
Eq. (6) is implicit in Eq. (8) itself.

Levy [10] has attacked the general problem, although without mentioning
explicitly the multiplicity concept involved. One of the results of his paper is
the following proposition:

PROPOSITION (Levy [10]). Let h(t, r) be the impulse response function of
a causal linear system. If h (t, t) is continuous and not zero m an interval [a, b]
and if the derivative 9h(t, T)/OT exists and is bounded m that interval then
H(x,t)=H(z,t),t(=[a,b).

Levy proved this proposition for the case where z(f) is Brownian motion.
Similarly, Hida [3], who refers to Levy's work and who generalized some of his
results, considered only Brownian motions for z(t) and Gaussian processes for
x(t). However, the concept of linear equivalence is a second-order property and

RANDOM PROCESSES                                             139

is in general not directly dependent on the distributions of the process. Thus, a
more general "white noise" can be taken to be the formal derivative of a process
with orthogonal increments. Many of Levy's results can be generalized directly
with minor modifications when an arbitrary process with orthogonal increments
is substituted for Brownian motion.

For example it is interesting to note that Levy's Proposition holds for arbi-
trary white noise3 ; that is, the following is true:

THEOREM 1. Let h(t, r) be the impulse response function of'a causal linear
system. Ifh(t, f) is continuous and not zero on an interval [a, b} and if the
derivative 9h(t, r)/3r exists and is continuous in that interval then H(x, t) =
H(z, t), t £ [a, b} for any input process z(t) with orthogonal increments.

Proof. For t G [a, b], the process x (?) is given by

x (t) =    h (t, r) dz (r), E [dz (r)]2 = dF(r)

J a

It is clear thstH(x, t) C H(z, t). It will therefore suffice to show that u i
H(z, t) and u l H(x, t) imply u = 0. We have

u e H(z, t) =&gt; u = j g(r)dz (r) for some ^(r) e L, (dF; a, t)

Ja

and

u].H(x,t)=i&gt;E[ux(s)] =0,Vx£ [a, t]

that is,

f h(s,T)g(r)dF(T)=0,\/se[a,t].               (9)

"a

Since dF is a o-finite measure, it follows that g(r)  L i (dF; a, t); consequently
G'(r) defined by dG(r) = g(T)dF(r) is of bounded variation over [a, t]. It is
possible to choose G(a) = 0; then G(s) is also bounded in [a, [}. Equation (9)
becomes

| /2(s,T)dG(r)=0,Vse [a,t].               (10)

Ja

Equation (10) can be integrated by parts since both G(r) and h(s, r) are of
bounded variation over [a, t}. The result is

^nder a slightly modified condition; that is, 3h (t, r)/9 T is assumed to be continuous.

G^{SG(r)^-^dr--Q^[a,t}.          (11)
Ja        'î\.sls)

Equation (11) is a homogeneous Volterra equation of the second kind and it is
known that its unique continuous Li solution is zero.4

Thus G(s) = 0, which implies

g(r) = 0 a.e. [dF]
and therefore

y=0. 

The theorem states that some "smooth" behavior of the impulse response
function together with the property that h (?, t) is continuously non-zero are
sufficient in order that the output be "equivalent" to any "white" noise input.
Notice that this proof does not hold for an infinite interval. However, the con-
cept of multiplicity is defined independently of the interval length and all re-
lated definitions can be translated to fit the finite interval restriction.

It would be useful to see how strong a necessary condition can be obtained.
In other words, given that the output x (t) is "equivalent" to some white noise
input, what can be inferred about h(t, r)?

It is convenient at this point to introduce some terminology and proposi-
tions, initially due to P. Levy [10]. It will then be apparent how a necessary
condition can be derived. Consider a fixed point u on the real line. Then
assume that there exist two points u and T such that « &lt; ü &lt; T and

with s = min {u, /} as diagrammed m Fig. 2. For each u there is a largest T
which is denoted by T(u). Either T(u) &gt; u, or T(u) does not exist. It is pos-
sible to decompose the real line into three disjoint sets A, B, and C as follows:

(i) u £ C, if u is a point of increase of F and T(u) = °°; that is, the innova-
tions associated with the input z(r) at these instants do not have an
effect on the output.

''The unique L^ solution is continuous because the kernel [9h(s, T)/9r]/h(s,s) is con-
tinuous [25].

that is, the innovations of 2(7-) at these instants have a delayed effect

(iii) u e A, if T(u) = u and u is not a left discontinuity of F or if u is not a
point of increase of F or if T(ù) does not exist; that is, the innovations
ofz(r) at these instants have an immediate effect on the output.

Definition 1. If B and C are empty, h(t, r) is called proper. If B is empty
h (t, r) is called semi-proper. If neither B nor C are empty h (t, r) is called
improper.

Definition 2. The impulse response h (t, r) is called canonical if V s &lt; r the
projection of JC (t) =,» h(t,T')dz(r) on//(Jc,s) is given by  A(r, T)dz(r).

Levy proved, for the case where z(r) is Brownian motion, that a necessary
and sufficient condition for H(x, t) = H(z, t) is that h(t, r) be proper and
canonical. It is easy to show that the same is true for any 2(7-) with orthogonal
increments. For example, the following necessary condition on h(t, r) can be
derived.

THEOREM 2. Ifh(t, T") and z(r),for arbitrary z(r) with orthogonal incre-
ments, are given and if the output x(t) satisfies H(x, t) =H(z, t), \/t then
h(t, r) must be proper.

Proof. If C is not empty there is at least one innovation dz(u), u £ C, which
has no effect on x (t), \/t, so that H(x, t) ^ H(z, t), \/t &gt; u. If B is not empty
there is at least one innovation dz(u), u £ B, which will have a delayed effect on

142                                    A. EPHREMIDES AND J. B. THOMAS

x(t); that is, H(x, u) ^ H(z, u). Therefore equality ofH(x, t) and H(z, t) for
all t is impossible and h(t, r) must be proper. 

Notice however that, in the semi-proper cnse,x(t) may have multiplicity one.
This may be accomplished by choosing another input cte'(r), coinciding with
dz(T) on A and being zero on C. Now h(t, r) becomes proper with respect to
this new z'(r).

COROLLARY . IfH(x, t) = H(z, t), V? £ R, then h{t, r) cannot be an analytic
function at some neighborhood of a point on the diagonal t = T unless [9^h 
(t, T)]/3^T|,.=f,;'= 0,1, 2,..., is nonzero m that neighborhood for at least
one i.

Proof. It should be emphasized that h(t, r) is defined only for T &lt; t since
otherwise its analyticity would imply that h{t, r) = 0 on the entire plane [h(t, r)
being identically zero for T &gt; t]. Now if

=0,/=0,1,2,
T=r

and ifh(t, T) is analytic at a neighborhood of(r, t), then h (t, r) = 0 on that
neighborhood (by the Taylor expansion). Therefore T(t) &gt; t and consequently
t e B. But if B is not empty, h (t, r) is not proper and H(x, t) ^ H(z, t). 

An example of a class of systems which is "invertible" is the class with im-
pulse functions of the form

where ip(t) and 0(r) are continuous and non-zero and where 6 (r) is differen-
tiable. The invertibility of such a system can be shown through the sufficient
condition of Theorem 1. Also note that the necessary condition is satisfied
since

I=^(t)f  eî(r)dF(-r)=0

"u-0

implies either that T{u) =°° [if u is not a point of increase ofF(r)] or that
T(u) =u [if u is a point of increase but not a left discontinuity of.F(7-)] or that
T(u) does not exist [ifu is a left discontinuity ofF(r)]. Systems with impulse
response h(t, r) given by Eq. (12) are encountered in practice and yield outputs
which have separable covariances (i.e., the outputs are wide sense Markov
processes).

Another widely used class of systems is the class of time-invariant systems.
These are not always invertible, but they are all at least semi-proper; that is, B
is empty. This is the case since, if u &lt; T(u) &lt; °° for some u, then h (t - u) is

RANDOM PROCESSES                                            143

identically zero for u &lt; t &lt; r(u); therefore all innovations are delayed by a
constant lag T(u) - u; consequently, a change to the new input

dz\r)=dz[T- [T(u)-u]}

eliminates this lag. Obviously, if A (0) ^ 0 and h is differentiable, the system
is invertible.

Another interesting class of systems is the one with impulse response func-
tions of the "Goursat" type; that is,

/z(r,T)=^&gt;,(00,(r).  .                   (13)

i=l

The smallest possible integer p in Eq. (13) is called the order of h(t, r). Levy
[10] has treated this class of systems at some length. Systems given by Eq. (13)
may be invertible, but they may also be improper. Finally there is a large va-
riety of system types which can be described in a similar way ; for example, if
h(t, 7-) = g(t - r)h' {t, r), a first-order reduction of the problem is obtained by
transferring the study o f h to that of h'.

III. CONDITIONS ON THE PROCESS

The second problem is to determine conditions on a given process x (?), so
that it can be modeled in an invertible way as the output of a causal, linear
system to a white noise input; that is

x(t)=l h(t,T)dz(r) (14)

with

H(x,t)=H(z,t),\/t&lt;ER.

Again, the restricted model of a lumped linear system that can be described by
a finite number of first-order linear differential equations has often been
adopted. However, there have been more general treatments. Stear [6] gives
an outline of work done on various aspects of this subject. Brandenburg [8]
considers first the problem in its generality and then concentrates on the state-
variable model in which case the solution to the problem depends upon a
Riccati differential equation. Again, the invertibility of the representation has
not been emphasized, and it is usually implicit in the particular model employed.
Recently, Kailath, Frost, and Geesey [11-15] have contributed several papers
on the subject concentrating on the causal invertibility of the representation.
However, the problem is not examined explicitly in the multiplicity framework
and the processes are usually restricted to be Gaussian. In a subsequent section

144                                    A. EPHREMIDES AND J. B. THOMAS

of this paper, the results obtained in these works are further discussed and re-
lated to the canonical decomposition of a process.

There are well defined classes of processes which admit the representation or
Eq. (14); for example, any wide sense stationary process x(t) with left and right
m.s. limits x(t ± 0) is necessarily everywhere m.s. continuous and has the well
known decomposition

x(t)=u(t)+v(t),

where u is deterministic, ü is pnd, and u l u. As it turns out, v(t) has the ca-
nonical decomposition [16] with only one term; that is,

£

with

E[dz(r)]2 =dr.

Thus any m.s. continuous pnd wide sense stationary process has multiplicity
one. For this class of processes there exists also the Paley-Wiener criterion
which determines whether the process is pnd through the properties of the
spectral distribution function.

Another example is the class of wide-sense Markov processes. These are
processes with autocovariance function of the form

Rxx (A s)=^ [max (t, s)]  Q [min (t, s)].

If&lt;&amp;and © have continuous derivatives and $'(?) © (0 - &lt;i&gt;(?)©'(f) &gt; 0, \/t
in an interval, then a causal linear system h(t, r) exists such thatJc(r) is the out-
put for white noise input with E [dz (r)]2 = (IT. Furthermore h(t, r) has a
separable form

{@(t)B(r),t&gt;T
^r)--!

1.0             t&lt;T.

There are also some slightly generalized results for Goursat functions of order
p &gt; 1 ; that is, where Rxx (t, s) = Sf, &lt;î&gt;, [max (t, s)] ©, [min (t, s)] and where
derivatives of higher-order exist [6, p. 140].

As was observed and proved earlier, if the multiplicity ofx(t) is unity, then
the kernel h(t, r) of the canonical representation cannot be analytic at t = r.
Similarly, the autocovariance function R^x (t, s) of a process with multiplicity
one cannot be analytic on the diagonal / = s, since the process then would be
deterministic [17]. It is easy to check that in the last two examples the auto-
covariance is indeed not analytic at t = s.

Let us now consider two important classes of processes not admitting the

RANDOM PROCESSES                                             145

representation of Eq. (14). The first is the class of deterministic processes; that
is, those with the qualifying property that H(x, -°°) = H(x, t), V?. For example,
band-limited random processes are deterministic. In [17] Belyaev gives several
examples of deterministic processes. It is interesting to notice that, although
a deterministic process can be obtained linearly from white noise and although
the transformation may be invertible, it fails to be causal. Thus, such a process
cannot be represented as in Eq. (14). Some other examples of deterministic
processes are the following. Any process whose autocovariance function R (t, s)
is a function of the sum of the two arguments [i.e., R(t, s) = ^(t + s)} is deter-
ministic. Any mean-square periodic process is also deterministic. Any process
given as a linear combination of a finite number of random variables is deter-
ministic; for example

x(t) = ai ^i (f) + ff, ^ (/)+...+ flyv ^JN (0,

where the a, are random variables and the ift-(/) functions of time. A peculiar
case is the following:

x(t)= cos(cuf+ i^)

with ip uniformly distributed in [-IT, n] and u a random variable with proba-
bility density/(cu). This process is wide sense stationary and its spectral den-
sity function is 7r/(o)). By the Paley-Wiener criterion, x(t) may or may not be
deterministic depending on the behavior of/(o)) as a; -&gt; °°. We now consider
the second class of process not admitting the representation of Eq. (14). These
are the pnd processes with multiplicity N &gt; 1.

Cramer [2, 18] has shown that processes can be found with any given multi-
plicity. In addition, he has shown that these processes can be chosen to be of
the harmonizable type [18]. However, it is not known how large or how inter-
esting this class is. Most of the examples known to date involve some sort of
pathological behavior, and it is Cramer's conjecture that most naturally gener-
ated pnd processes possessing some vaguely defined "smoothness" properties
do have multiplicity one. Nevertheless, processes with N &gt; 1 exist and a very
good example [18] shows that the "pathology" involved may be hidden in the
inner structure of the process, while on the surface the process appears quite
well-behaved. The example is the following. Let

x(t)= (   h^t,T)dz,(r)+( h,(t,T)dz,(T)          (15)

* oo                                   * -oo

with £ [dz, (r)]2 =c?F,(r) for ;= l, 2 and z i (r) l z, (s), Vr, s (ET?. LetFi and
F^ be of any given spectral type and let hi be given by

hi(t, r) = ) ai(u)(t-u)du,i=l,2,

v T

146                                   A. EPHREMIDES AND J. B. THOMAS

where ai (u) and a^ (u) are the characteristic functions of two disjoint subsets
of the real Une with the property that

r6

oii(u)du&gt;0,i=l,2

"a

for any a and b {a &lt; b)5. Then it turns out that

H(x,t)=H(zi,t)®H(z,,t),\/teR.

Hence Eq. (15) gives the canonical decomposition ofx(t), which therefore has
multiplicity two. Note that hi and h^ aie continuous functions of their argu-
ments, differentiable a.e., and that the only "pathology" lies in the functions
Ot,(it). Furthermore, x(t) itself is m.s. differentiable for all t £ R with derivative
x'(t) given by

&gt;=(  ai(T)zi(r)^T+ (

-'-oc                             » -oc

X'(.t) =     ai (T)Zi (T)dT +      a, (T)Z, (T-)A-.

J - oc                           »-en

The process x(t) is also twice m.s. differentiable for almost all t £ R with

JC"(0=Qi(f)Zi (0+^(^(0.                   (16)

The process given by Eq. (16) for all t is not a process with orthogonal incre-
ments, although z i (t) and z 2 (t) are such processes, and, of course, the left and
right m.s. limits x"(t ± 0) do not exist. Notice, however, that

RX'X" (t, s) = ai (Oui (s)Fi [min (t, s)] + c^ (t)a-t (s)F^ [nun (t, s)]

which is an example of Levy's Goursat functions of order 2. This autocovariance
exhibits some irregular behavior due to the nature of the a,(T); however, the
autocovariance ofx(t), which can be obtained by successive integrations of
^x"x" (^ O. is well-behaved with respect to continuity and differentiability,
even though its mathematical expression is complicated due to the presence of
multiple integrals. Thus the pathology possibly inherent in the generation of a
random process with multiplicity N greater than unity is not necessarily ap-
parent in the process' autocovariance function. Nevertheless the autocovariance
remains the factor determining the value OÎN.

Another example given by Hida [3] is the following. Let Zi (t) and z^ (/)
be two mutually orthogonal random processes with orthogonal increments (for
simplicity consider two independent Brownian motions) and let

f Zi(t), t rational
[z-i (t), t irrational.

5 Such sets exist as is proved in [18].

RANDOM PROCESSES                                            147

Then

H(x,t)=H(z,,t)9H(z,,t)
and

x(t) = (   h(t, r)dz, (r) +    [1 - h(t, r)] dz, (r)

^-oo                          "-oo

where

[ 1, t rational
h(t,T)= \

[O, t irrational.

Therefore the multiplicity of x(f) is equal to two. However, this process is
strongly discontinuous [the limits x(t ± 0) do not exist for any t] and does
not belong to the class of processes considered in this paper.

Another example of a process with multiplicity greater than one is given by
Cramer [2] and, although it is a rather trivial process, it exhibits a behavior very
similar to that of the last example, illustrating that the irregularity of a process
with N &gt; 1 may be well hidden in the foundations of the process. Furthermore,
in many cases, the irregularity may consist of the existence of two or more
disjoint sets on the real line, infinitely closely intermixed6, on each of which a
component of each separate term of the canonical decomposition is supported.

A knowledge of the size and significance of the class of pnd processes with
N= 1 is therefore important and conditions [preferably on the auto co variance
function R^x (t, s)] in order that N = 1 are desirable. This problem seems to be
difficult. Sufficient conditions are known for Gaussian processes based on no-
tions of measure-equivalence which are widely used in detection theory [19, 20,
21]. For non-Gaussian processes, these notions do not coincide with the linear
equivalence defined by Eq. (14).

In particular, Kailath and others [11-15,19] have considered the classical
linear estimation of a signal corrupted by white noise. The problem is to esti-
mate Z' (t) with minimum mean-square error by a linear operation on the past
observations Y(s), s &lt; t, given by

Y(s) = Z(s) + N(s),

where N(t) is a process with orthogonal increments. Under mild restrictions on
Z(t) and if N(t) is a Wiener process, it has been proved [11-15, 19] that the
process y(t} defined by

/t
y(f)-Y(f)-    Z'

oo

\t)dt

6 As, for example, the sets whose characteristic functions are the a,(u) ofEq. (16).

148                                    A. EPHREMIDES AND J. B.THOMAS

where Z'(t) is the least-mean-squared estimate (not necessarily linear) is also a
Wiener process. Furthermore, it is equivalent to Y(t) in the sense that

B(y,t)=BCY,t),VtER,                 (17)

where B denotes the o-algebra of co-sets generated by the respective random
variables for s &lt; t. The process y (t) is called the innovation process of Y(t)
and is widely used in detection theory.

dark [22] showed that sufficient conditions on Z(t) for Eq. (17) to hold are

(i) Z(t} independent ofN(f)
(ü) E Sï l Z '{t) | dt &lt; °° where Z '(t) is the derivative of Z(t).

(iii)    sup   | Z '(t) | &lt; c a.e. for a suitable constant c.
o &lt;t&lt;r

However, this result does not imply that the process y(t) is linearly equivalent
to Y(t) [i.e., that Y(t) has multiplicity one], since the equality of the o-algebras
generated by the pasts of two processes does not in general imply equality of
the corresponding Hubert spaces. For example, consider two random variables
defined by

fl,c&gt;;eî2i
X,(u)=\

[o,a&gt;en2

Î2i 0^2 =0

f0,ai£î2i
Xz((^)=\

ll,o;eS22.

The o-algebras generated by Xi and X^, respectively, are both equal to {0, Î2i,
Sî'i, Sîi U ÎÎ2 }. However, the spaces spanned by them are orthogonal to each
other. Even if two random variables are Gaussian, equality of the o-algebras
does not imply equality of the Hubert spaces. For example if

IX-i (CL&gt;) on a set Î2i (of non-zero measure)
-XT, (co) on Hi (of non-zero measure)

thenB(Xi)=B(X^),butH(X^^H(Xz). However the particular way in which
y(t) and Y(t) are related might imply equality of the spaces H(y, t) and H(Y, t),
and, under some conditions, it does.

The following theorem [23] constitutes a generalization of the Wiener prop-
erty of ^(r).

THEOREM 3. If Y(t) = Z(f) + N(t) and if
(i) Z(t) and N(t) are orthogonal to each other
(ü) N(t) has orthogonal increments,

then y(t) = Y(t) - Z (t), where Z (t) denotes the linear, least mean-square esti-
mate ofZ(t) given Y(s), s &lt; t, is a process with orthogonal increments.

Proof. Let us write Z (?) as Py [Z(Q] ; that is, as the projection of Z{t) on
H(Y,t). Then

3/(0=r(0-/^[Z(f»]
and

H(y,t)CH(Y,t).                      (18)
Let s &lt; /; then

and

^(0 = Z(s) + N(s) + [Z(t) - Z(s)] + [N(t) - N(s)] - P^ [Z(s)]

-^[Z(0-Z(,)]-P^[Z(0].
Therefore the increment [y(t) - y(s)} is given by

y{t) - y(s) = [Z(Q - Z(s)] + [N(t) - N(s)] - P^ [Z(Q - Z(s)} - Py [Z(t)].
Obviously, we have

z(o-^[Z(0]l//(^)
p^^z^i^y,.)

Z(s)-PSY[Z(s)}lH(Y,s)
N(t)-N(s)lH(Y,s).
Consequently the increment obeys

andbyEq.(18)

y(f)- y(s)lH(y,s).

Thus y (t) has orthogonal increments. 

This last theorem shows an explicit way to obtain a "white noise" process
from Y(t) by a causal, linear operation. This can always be done, since the
canonical decomposition of any process suggests that N uncorrelated "white
noises" can be obtained in this way if TV is the multiplicity of the process. The
question is whether the process y(f) is equivalent to Y(f), that is whether
H(y, f) = H(Y, t). When B(y, f) = B(Y, t), that is when dark's conditions
[22] on Z(t~) and N(t) are satisfied, in order for the spaces H(y, t) and H(Y, t)
to be equal it is sufficient that Z(t) and N(t) are jointly Gaussian or, more gen-
erally, spherically invariant. Then the least-mean-square (l.m.s.) estimate Z (t)
is linear in the past observations and H(y, t) C H(Y, t). Because of the equality

150                                  A. EPHREMIDES AND J. B. THOMAS

of the o-algebras, Z (t) is equal to the l.m.s. estimate of Z(t) given the past of
y(t). Let us denote this estimate by Z (f). Then in

y(t)=Y(t)-Z(t)

we substitute Z(t) = P', [Z(t)} for Z(t) and obtain
Y(t)=y(t)+Pty[Z(t
Consequently

and

This discussion leads to the conclusion that a random process Y(t) = Z(t)+
N(t), with Z(f) and N(t) satisfying dark's conditions and m addition being
jointly spherically invariant, has multiplicity one.

At this point, an interesting question can be asked. If the sum of two pro-
cesses has multiplicity one, is it true that each process itself has multiplicity
one? The answer is, in general, no. Were it yes or if, under some conditions, it
is yes, then we have a powerful statement connecting distribution and sample
function properties on one hand with second-order moment properties on the
other. This statement would be the following.

PROPOSITION . If a random process h(t)=Z '(t) is Gaussian and satisfies
Clark's conditions, then it has unit multiplicity.

However, there are counterexamples disproving this proposition. In particu-
lar it is easy to find Gaussian processes satisfying Clark's conditions which are
either deterministic or have arbitrary multiplicity. This discrepancy is again
explainable in terms of the space Hy (Y, t) encountered in the first section of
this paper.

From the orthogonality between Z(f) and N(t) it follows that

and

P [Y(t)} =Z(t)

where P denotes the projection on H(Z). Let

H(Y,6)=H(Y,f) ©^(T.s)
where 5 = (s, t]. In general

P[H(Y,6)}^H(Z,b).

RANDOM PROCESSES                                            151

If the last relation were an equality, it would follow that Mult (Z) &lt;S Mult
(Y). However, it is true that

P  [//(y,ô)]=//(z,§)                 (i9)

H(Z,S)

that is, the projection OÎHÇY, Ô) on H(Z, 5) covers the entire latter space.
Therefore, there exists a subspace H'(Y, 5) C H(Y, 5) isomorphic to H(Z, §).
It is necessary to look at the asymptotic behavior of this isomorphism as Ô -* 0.
Unfortunately, the projection relationship expressed by Eq. (19) need not hold
m the limit; that is, it is possible, for example, tliat the space defined by Ho 
(Y, s) = rig &gt; o H(Y, s + ô) QH(Y, s) is zero, while Ho (Z, s) is not, or that the
dimension oîHoÇY, s) is less than that of Ho(Z, s). If however dim Ho(Z, s) &lt;
dim Ho ( Y, s), V s e R, then the isomorphism is well-defined and has the
properties

(i) H{Z, t} ~ H \Y, t) C H(Y, t), \/t e R
(ii) H(Z, 5) ~ H '(Y, 8) C H(Y, ô), VS e R

and therefore mult (Z) = mult (Y ') &lt; mult (Y). The significance of the dimen-
sionality of Hy(Z, s) is not intuitively clear, but it provides a condition that per-
mits statements of the type we are looking for. For example, the following
proposition is true.

PROPOSITION. If a Gaussian random process h(f} satisfies Clark's conditions
and ifH(h, s) = ("Ig &gt; g H(h, s + §), Vs £ R, then the process has multiplicity
one.
Further results of a similar nature will be found in [23].

The conditions derived thus far are rather restrictive and expressed in some-
what obscure terms. Certainly they are not of the desired type; that is, they are
not conditions on the autocovariance function, which is the only quantity deter-
mining the multiplicity of the process. The Paley-Wiener criterion for widesense
stationary processes is a typical criterion of the desired kind. In the general case,
a more straightforward approach to the problem does not seem to lead to more
satisfactory results. However, these results do throw some light on the multi-
plicity structure of the process, and therefore some attention will be focused on
them in the remainder of the paper.

Recently, Cramer [24, p. 14, Theorem 5.1] gave a sufficient condition in
order that N = l. This condition is not of immediate use, but it suggests that, if
a pnd process is to have multiplicity N &gt; 1, either the kernels in its canonical
representation or the distribution functions of its constituent white noises must
exhibit some pathological behavior. From a similar line of reasoning, a slightly
different condition can be derived, which confirms the irregular behavior of
processes with multiplicity N &gt; l. This condition shows the degree of irregu-
larity required in any finite interval and with reference to any two terms of the

152                                    A. EPHREMIDES AND J. B. THOMAS

canonical decomposition. In this sense it appears to constitute a useful comple-
ment to Cramer's condition.

IV. AN APPLICATION TO LEAST-MEAN-SQUARE ESTIMATION

A technique widely used in the construction of linear least mean-square
estimators is the "prewhitening" method introduced by Bode and Shannon [26]
for wide sense stationary processes and applied since for a much wider class of
processes. This technique consists of passing the observation process y(t) =
x(f) + n(t) through a prewhitening filter and then through an estimating filter,
providing a factorization of the best estimator. It is apparent from the previous
discussion that this factorization is possible without loss of information only
when y(t), or, more correctly, its "integral" Y(t) has multiplicity one. Conse-
quently, whenever the process Y(f) contains a deterministic component or is
pnd with multiplicity greater than one, the prewhitening method is not
applicable.

To derive the linear l.m.s. estimator by the prewhitening technique when
N&gt; 1, multiple or parallel prewhitening must be considered, as illustrated in
Fig. 3 for N = 1. It is easy to check, using elementary projection theory, that

of the role of multiplicity in least mean-square estimation can be found in [27],

					<ce:simple-para view="all">The modeling of a random process as the output of a linear, causal, and causally invertible filter has been considered by a number of authors. Various approaches that have been used are summarized here. The spectral multiplicity of the random process plays a fundamental role in this problem and permits a general and unified approach. In this framework, necessary or sufficient conditions for unit multiplicity are obtained on the system's impulse response function and on the output process itself. The role of spectral multiplicity in linear least-mean-square estimation is also clarified.</ce:simple-para>
